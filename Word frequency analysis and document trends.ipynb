', '', 'The XP conference attracts a large number of software practitioners and researchers, ', 'providing a rare opportunity for interaction between the two communities.

The integration of user-centred design and Agile development is ', 'becoming increasingly common in companies and appears promising. However, ', 'it may also present some critical points, or communication breakdowns, such as ', 'a variable interpretation of user involvement, a mismatch in the value of docu¬ ', 'mentation, and a misalignment in iterations. We refine these themes, emerging ', 'from both literature and previous fieldwork, by analysing a case study performed ', 'in an IT company that adopts both software engineering approaches, and we ', 'further extend the framework with a new theme related to task ownership. We ', 'argue that communication breakdowns can become focal points to drive action ', 'and decision for establishing an organisational context acknowledging the value ', 'of user involvement: to this end, we suggest the adoption of design thinking and ', 'the active engagement of the customer in embracing its values. ', '', 'Keywords: Communication breakdowns • Organisational culture • Case study ', '', '', '1 Introduction ', '', 'In recent years we have witnessed a growing interest in the integration of Agile meth¬ ', 'odologies with user-centred design (UCD), in order to achieve a more holistic software ', 'engineering approach. In fact, UCD and Agile show some complementary aspects: on ', 'the one hand, UCD does not address how to implement the software, while Agile ', 'provides large flexibility in accommodating changing requirements; on the other hand, ', 'Agile does not directly address user experience (UX) aspects, although valuing customer ', 'involvement in the development process. ', '', 'However, even though the integration of UCD and Agile appears promising, it also ', 'presents some issues and no fully satisfactory approach to it has been found yet. In ', 'particular, three communication breakdowns [4] hampering such integration have been ', 'identified [5], namely a variable interpretation of user involvement, a mismatch in the ', 'value of documentation, and a misalignment in iteration phases. In this paper, we refine ', 'this framework by discussing a new case study looking at the practices of a software ', 'and interaction design company. To support our analysis, we define the main actors ', 'involved and how they are mutually linked in a communication network, comparing the ', 'latter with the one resulting from the case study presented in [5]. Despite the differences ', 'in the two working contexts, the three themes manifest anyway and an additional point, ', 'related to task ownership, emerges. We conclude by discussing how these ', '', '', '© The Author(s) 2016 ', '', 'H. Sharp and T. Hall (Eds.): XP 2016, LNBIP 251, pp. 3-15, 2016. ', 'DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-33515-5_1 ', '', '', '4 ', '', '', 'S. Bordin and A. De Angeli ', '', '', 'communication breakdowns can become focal points to support action and decision in ', 'companies adopting UCD and Agile; moreover, we argue that possible solutions to these ', 'issues need to be backed by a supportive organisational culture that recognises the value ', 'of user contribution and actively endorses it with the customer. ', '', '', '2 Related Work ', '', 'User-centred design (UCD) is an umbrella term used to denote a set of techniques, ', 'methods, procedures that places the user at the centre of an iterative design process [25]. ', 'The benefits of involving users in systems design are widely acknowledged [1, 14,16, 18]: ', 'they include improved quality and acceptance of the system [11], and cost saving, since ', 'unnecessary features or critical usability issues are spotted early in the development ', 'process [23]. In recent years, there have been several attempts at integrating UCD with ', 'Agile software development, as witnessed for instance by the literature reviews in [15,26]. ', 'Despite the large common ground that the two approaches share, there are at least three ', 'themes on which their perspectives diverge [5]: we frame these themes by drawing on the ', 'concept of communication breakdown, that is a “disruption that occurs when previously ', 'successful work practices fail, or changes in the work situation (new work-group, new ', 'technology, policy, etc.) nullify specific work practices or routines of the organizational ', 'actors and there are no ready-at-hand recovery strategies” [4]. Although originally ', 'discussed with respect to global software development, we believe that this concept can ', 'support a reflection on the synthesis of different software engineering approaches: we ', 'argue, in fact, that it refers to issues occurring at “work practice level” that are due to an ', '“underdeveloped shared context of meaning” [4], which could also be interpreted as the ', 'incomplete establishment of a common ground [10] between designers and developers of ', 'the same company. ', '', 'The three communication breakdowns in the integration of UCD and Agile were ', 'formalised during a field study carried out within the Smart Campus project [5], where ', 'UCD and Scrum were integrated in a process of mobile application development for a ', 'community of users, namely students of the University of Trento campus. The goal of ', 'this R&D project was to create an ecosystem fostering students’ active participation in ', 'the design and development of mobile services for their own campus [12]; more details ', 'about the aims and results of the project can be found in [6, 12, 34]. In the following, ', 'we will illustrate the three communication breakdowns identified by drawing on the ', 'literature review that supported the findings of the Smart Campus field study. ', '', 'User Involvement. In UCD, user involvement can range from informative, to consul¬ ', 'tative, to participative [11]. In Agile instead, the emphasis is rather put on the customer ', '[1], who acts as a representative of users, but may or may not have direct and regular ', 'contact with them [27, 28], to the point that some authors question the extent of such ', 'representativeness [30] and others recommend that the customer role is supported by ', 'members of the project team [9]. ', '', 'Documentation. Both UCD and Agile encourage frequent communication among ', 'team members; however, there can be issues in the communication between designers ', '', '', 'Focal Points for a More User-Centred Agile Development ', '', '', '5 ', '', '', 'and developers [1] and in the role of documentation in this respect. In fact, UCD suggests ', 'the use of several artefacts such as personas and prototypes to record requirements and ', 'design rationales [28], while Agile promotes face-to-face conversation as the most ', 'effective means of communication in its fundamental principles [3], to the point of ', 'incorporating the customer in the development team.

There are different schools of thought about whether UCD ', 'and Agile should be merged into a unified software engineering process, leveraging on their ', 'common practices [19, 35, 37], or should just proceed in parallel [20, 24, 33]. ', '', '3 H-umus ', '', 'We will now discuss a field study performed in H-umus, presented in their website ', 'as a “software and interaction design company”. Born in 2007 in one of the most ', 'well known Italian venture incubators, H-umus designs and develops mobile sales ', 'tools for the fashion industry and now belongs to a large Italian software and serv¬ ', 'ices business. The personnel include a CEO, a CTO, four project managers (two of ', 'whom are also interaction designers), and five developers. The company adopts a ', 'customised version of Scrum for the development and follows a loose interaction ', 'design approach. At present, H-umus offers two main products to an established ', 'customer portfolio: a B2B merchandising platform and a time and expenses ', 'accounting tool. The company also follows some ad-hoc projects for more occa¬ ', 'sional customers: we consider here the development of a mobile tool for a leading ', 'fashion brand that we will call FashionX.

The dialogue with ', 'users is completely mediated by the customer, usually represented by the IT department ', 'of a large fashion business. The customer in turn communicates with H-umus through ', 'a project manager of this company, who is often also an interaction designer; such ', 'dialogue is supported by a series of artefacts such as requirements documents, proto¬ ', 'types, and cost or time estimates, which will be described more in detail in later para¬ ', 'graphs. The project manager is then usually the only point of contact between the inside ', 'and outside of H-umus: he collaborates with the management (i.e. the CEO) in the early ', 'stages of an approach to a new customer, with the CTO in the definition of the technical ', 'analysis, and with developers during the implementation.

In this paragraph, we will describe the most relevant ones. ', '', 'Mockups and Wireframes. In the case of enhancements to already consolidated prod¬ ', 'ucts, designers prepare high-fidelity mockups relying on the existing interface; in the ', 'case of software built from scratch instead, they prepare wireframes, representing inter¬ ', 'action flows and layouts. Mockups and wireframes are then iteratively discussed with ', 'the customer: this allows to check that requirements have been correctly understood, to ', 'ensure that the customer is aware of project status and will not change his mind later, ', 'and to skip formal validation steps at the end of each sprint.

Prototypes and requirements are integrated in documents called briefs, which ', 'crystallise the requirements; they are then iteratively revised with the customer to ensure ', 'that both parties share the same understanding of requirements and status of advance¬ ', 'ment. ', '', 'Roadmaps. For each project, the relevant project manager keeps a chart showing the ', 'evolution of the product at a high level, including milestones to be delivered to the ', 'customer. This chart is often linked to other documents reporting, for instance, more ', 'extensive descriptions of functionalities or specifications of the customer’s target plat¬ ', 'forms. Roadmaps are used internally, at management level: the CEO, the CTO and ', 'project managers refer to them to supervise the status of each project. However, if the ', 'customer requires so, roadmaps are also used to provide long-term visibility on the ', 'articulation of the project. ', '', 'Technical Analysis. The CTO elaborates this document for each project: it includes ', 'finalised interface mockups, a description of the data flow and of the data structure, cost ', 'and time estimates, and a finer-grained breakdown of development tasks. The technical ', 'analysis serves two purposes: internally, it is a reference for developers to determine ', 'what to implement in the next sprints; externally and if needed, it can provide the ', 'customer with a detailed understanding of the implementation process. ', '', '3.4 Findings ', '', 'In the following, we discuss the results of the interviews with the H-umus staff, cate¬ ', 'gorising the narratives according to the three communication breakdowns constituting ', 'our framework. Citations in the next paragraphs will be attributed to interviewees as ', 'follows: Dev for developers; Des for designers; PM for project managers who are not ', 'designers; Mgmt for the CTO and the CEO. ', '', 'User Involvement. The distinction between customers and users is very sharp and ', 'project managers usually communicate only with the customer, who can be represented ', 'by different employees at different stages of the same project. Especially when the ', 'customer is a large company, its most appropriate representative to liaise with can be ', 'difficult to identify and often changes over time: ', '', 'Dev2: “The most difficult thing in communicating with the customer is understanding ', 'who you should be talking to. ” ', '', 'In general, the customer representative is the IT department: ', '', 'Mgmt2: “You would not believe how conservative IT departments can be. Whatever ', \"change may affect their working routine, it's a no-no. ” \", '', 'There are, however, exceptions to this situation: for example, a few demos were ', 'arranged with business and sales representatives of FashionX, i.e. with a sample of final ', 'users, in order to collect feedback that could supplement the requirements provided by ', '', '', '', '8 ', '', '', 'S. Bordin and A. De Angeli ', '', '', 'the IT department of the company. Yet, this only happens occasionally: usually, and as ', 'shown in Fig. 1, the customer completely mediates user needs, requirements, and feed¬ ', 'back. This causes some concern in the H-umus management: ', '', 'Mgmt2: “Then it is difficult to determine how to handle the feedback we receive and ', 'how relevant it actually is with respect to the customer or with respect to the needs users ', 'may truly have. [...] Sometimes I wonder whom we should really satisfy. Is it the business ', 'department or the IT department? We usually speak only to the latter. I believe this ', 'causes a large drop in the value we deliver with our products. ” ', '', 'H-umus designers acknowledge that it would be desirable to apply a proper user- ', 'centred design methodology, involving real users in requirement gathering and interface ', 'evaluation. However, this is very hard to achieve in practice, because of two main ', 'reasons: first, the time for design is constrained; second, it is difficult to gain access to ', 'users. In fact, the customer is not always interested in being actively involved in the ', 'design of the commissioned product: sometimes H-umus may only be asked to prototype ', 'a new graphical interface for an existing software. The customer may even believe that ', 'users are not able to provide any sensible contribution: ', '', 'Devi: “Ido not have any contact with users [...] Sometimes they are even described to ', 'me as being as dumb as an ox, so it is paramount to design products that are very easy ', 'to use, and I guess this is a major challenge for designers. ” ', '', 'Documentation. The staff has a small size and is co-located in the same open space: ', 'hence, most coordination occurs face to face or at most through instant messaging, both ', 'among developers and between developers and designers. This leads to a scarcity of ', 'documentation for internal use. However, in order to avoid knowledge gaps in case ', 'someone leaves the company, pair programming is adopted when a part of the code ', 'needs to be modified: the task is in fact assigned both to the developer who already ', 'worked on that code and to a “fresh” developer at the same time. In this way, in the long ', 'run everybody will have at least an overview of all the code produced. Working in pairs ', 'is also a common practice in the early stages of a new project, where a designer and a ', 'developer cooperate in order to shape the design space quickly and based on an under¬ ', 'standing of what can be technically feasible. ', '', 'PM1: “Everybody has an overview, but also a specific responsibility. ” ', '', 'Documentation is instead actively and carefully maintained to support the relation¬ ', 'ship with the customer. Despite the Agile principle [3] of “embracing change”, the ', 'management highlighted the need of making the customer responsible for his require¬ ', 'ments and committed to them. The CTO and the project managers in fact insisted on ', 'their strong need to shield H-umus from sudden, important changes in customer require¬ ', 'ments; being the company so small, this could cause a lot of work to be wasted and not ', 'paid, causing in turn potentially severe financial issues. ', '', '', 'Focal Points for a More User-Centred Agile Development ', '', '', '9 ', '', '', 'PM1: “H-umus is a small company. If the customer first says he wants a mobile app, ', 'and then after six months he comes and says that now he wants a standalone applica¬ ', 'tion... We cannot afford that. Unless the customer is paying for the extra time, of ', 'course. ” ', '', 'Des2: “We do not have much development capacity. It can become a big issue if I draw ', 'the mockup and then we have to go back and change fundamental parts of it. ” ', '', 'This protection is achieved by using several artefacts that are admittedly not typically ', 'Agile: documents such as requirements lists and technical analyses are shared with the ', 'customer, iteratively discussed and then signed off. ', '', 'Mgmtl: “We make the customer sign the requirements document, so nobody can come ', 'up and say: “This is not what we agreed upon A Whatever extra, we discuss it and it is ', 'billed on top. ” ', '', 'Des2: “Being able to tell the customer: “Look, this is what we suggested and you ', 'approved it” is something that can cover our back when we need to ask for more funding ', 'or when we just say that something is not feasible ”. ', '', 'The strong perception of documentation as having a purpose mainly in relation to ', 'the customer emerges very clearly also in relation to other themes: ', '', 'Mgmtl: “I’ll show you the technical analysis we did for FashionX [...] Please write ', 'down in your notes that to me this is complete nonsense. The risk estimates and the ', 'planning poker and stuff... It is obvious that these numbers are meaningless. Yet the ', 'customer wants to have a long-term perspective on the project, so here it is. ” ', '', 'Synchronisation of Iterations. Given the small size of the company, designers and ', 'developers work together, so synchronisation is handled through constant, direct ', 'communication. Indeed, there is no separate process for design and for development: ', 'for instance, design tasks such as prototyping are listed as regular user stories in the ', 'Agile management tool in use: ', '', 'Desl: “UX aspects are regarded as common functionalities. ” ', '', 'Despite a general awareness among the staff of the company transitioning towards ', 'a more design-oriented culture, the overall attitude appears to be still strongly technical. ', 'For instance, sprint meetings only involve developers: ', '', 'Mgmtl: “We are born as a data-driven company [...] Sprint meetings are too technical; ', 'designers would waste time attending them. ” ', '', 'Furthermore, a different theme emerges, related to the recognition of designers’ ', 'expertise in a technically dominant environment. Several times designers referred to ', 'their competence in UX as being interpreted as common sense in the company: ', '', '', '', '10 ', '', '', 'S. Bordin and A. De Angeli ', '', '', 'Des2: “Why should the CEO’s opinion be more relevant than mine, if I designed the ', 'interface from the beginning? Sometimes [Desl ] and I refer to it as a class conflict with ', 'the developers ” ', '', 'Des2: “Everybody feels entitled to comment on the design, just because each of us is a ', 'technology user, while nobody would comment on the code unless competent. So [devel¬ ', 'opers ] bring in their own use cases, but we are not developing, say, Instagram, which ', 'only has a couple of functionalities: it is totally different. Sometimes the comments are ', 'just “I don’t like it”. I can take it from the customer, if he pays for the extra time needed ', 'to rework the design, otherwise Ed expect some sounder feedback. ” ', '', 'The rest of the team perceives this issue as well, although in variable ways: ', '', 'Devi: “Interfaces are subjective [...] usability is subjective too: you need to design stuff ', 'that is comfortable for the user, more than functional. [Desl and Des2] do a great job ', 'in my opinion in this respect. ” ', '', 'PM1: “The best way to work shouldn’t be to tell the designer how to do the things, but ', 'just what you need; unfortunately, the customer is often unable to articulate what he ', 'wants, and anyway we must give priority to the development to save time. ” ', '', 'Dev2: “We all give our opinion, but in the end it is the designer who decides. ” ', '', '4 Discussion ', '', 'Despite a positive attitude towards UCD, H-umus found objective difficulties in inte¬ ', 'grating it with Agile in practice. These difficulties were partially overlapping with the ', 'communication breakdowns identified in Smart Campus [5], although the working ', 'context of the latter was quite different from the H-umus one as illustrated by Fig. 2, ', 'which represents the main actors in Smart Campus and their communication network. ', '', '', '', 'Fig. 2. Communication network in Smart Campus. ', '', '', 'The analysis of the H-umus case study allowed us to refine our framework, broad¬ ', 'ening the scope of identified communication breakdowns as follows. ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Focal Points for a More User-Centred Agile Development ', '', '', '11 ', '', '', 'User Involvement. In Smart Campus, the customer and the user community were two ', 'clearly differentiated actors; most of the team had direct contact only with the users ', 'through a variety of communication channels such as a forum. However, the perception ', 'of user involvement appeared to be variable between designers and developers, denoting ', 'an underlying mismatch in the understanding of this concept: while designers struggled ', 'to promote a participative role of the user community, developers intended such role as ', 'informative or at most consultative instead [11]. In H-umus, the extent of user involve¬ ', 'ment remains problematic, although with a different flavour: the customer completely ', 'mediates the interaction with the user, so the role of the latter is practically less than ', 'informative [11]. Therefore, we can argue that the understanding of the extent of user ', 'involvement should be shared not only inside the company (among designers, devel¬ ', 'opers, managers), but also outside, by the customer. ', '', 'Documentation. In Smart Campus, documentation did not appear to have an intrinsic ', 'value as a communication tool for developers; however, it became increasingly relevant ', 'to keep the development team aligned when the latter became more distributed due to ', 'the introduction of interns working at variable times and often remotely. Yet, how to ', 'effectively support the need for a shared knowledge base remained an open point, ', 'particularly referring to design artefacts, although the team tried to adopt a variety of ', 'articulation platforms. In H-umus instead, the team is co-located: in this case, besides ', 'being a tool for tracing the history of the software and the rationale of related design ', 'and development choices, documentation can also have an instrumental function in ', 'balancing the power relationship with the customer, protecting the company against ', 'unsustainable changes in requirements. ', '', 'Synchronisation of Iterations. The Smart Campus project was oriented towards a ', 'large and strong user community, whose feedback escalated quickly and was not medi¬ ', 'ated (for instance by a customer). This caused severe difficulties in synchronising the ', 'iterations of UCD and Agile: designers struggled to elaborate requirements and provide ', 'suggestions in a timely manner that could fit the development pace, while developers ', 'often took the initiative of fixing interfaces regardless of the overall UX vision. In ', 'general, designers resorted to several ad-hoc interventions, elaborated together with the ', 'developers requesting them. In H-umus instead, the team is co-located and quite small, ', 'so synchronisation can easily occur through face-to-face communication. Furthermore, ', 'the existence of signed documents prevents the customer from changing requirements ', 'with the same frequency witnessed in Smart Campus with the user community. ', '', 'Task Ownership. An additional communication breakdown strongly emerged from ', 'the interviews conducted in H-umus. Several interviewees argued that, in order for an ', 'effective communication to occur, it is advisable that the whole team shares a common ', 'language. Additionally, our observations suggested that the team should also share a ', 'common understanding about who is responsible for each task, especially in the case of ', 'UX activities, and in particular for taking final decisions over it. This will help avoid ', 'situations in which a technically predominant environment interprets UX as mere ', '“common sense”, which are not conducive to endorsing the added value that UX can ', 'provide to a product and which seem to reflect a long-lasting contrast between soft and ', '', '', '12 ', '', '', 'S. Bordin and A. De Angeli ', '', '', 'hard sciences. To this end, we point to the concept of boundary objects, i.e. mediating ', 'artefacts that allow knowledge sharing and promote collaboration since their interpretive ', 'flexibility facilitates “an overlap of meaning while preserving sufficient ambiguity” for ', 'different groups to read their own meanings [2]. The briefs used in H-umus can be ', 'considered as boundary objects in this sense, as they gather mockups from designers, ', 'technical specs from developers, and business requirements from the customer, and they ', 'act as a common reference point for monitoring the evolution of the product. ', '', '', '5 Conclusion ', '', 'In this paper we have discussed four communication breakdowns that may affect the ', 'integration of user-centred design and Agile development and that emerged from an ', 'analysis of working practices in companies. Possible solutions can derive from discount ', 'usability techniques [e.g. 13, 22] or more recent research on automatic usability evalu¬ ', 'ation tools [e.g. 21, 31]. However, we remark that communication breakdowns are ', 'manifested at the work process level [4, 5]: hence, we suggest that their solution could ', 'be found in a supportive organisational environment [5, 8, 11, 17], whose fundamental ', 'importance is reiterated by the present study. As seen in H-umus, not even having ', 'designers play the role of project managers is enough to fully endorse the UCD compo¬ ', 'nent of the working process. To leverage the full potential of the integration of UCD ', 'and Agile, the management should actively counteract the so-called “developer mindset” ', '[1, 14], i.e. an approach that is overly focused on technical aspects rather than on ', 'customer and user satisfaction, and commit to an explicit inclusion of UCD in company ', 'goals and financial allocation [36]. ', '', 'We claim that the four communication breakdowns discussed in this paper can ', 'become focal points to drive action and decision in companies, facilitating communi¬ ', 'cation between designers and developers and supporting management in the construc¬ ', 'tion of a favourable context. Our current research is addressing the development of ', 'specific guidelines concerning how to apply such focal points in practice through addi¬ ', 'tional case studies. Nonetheless, and as already suggested in [5], we believe that design ', 'thinking [7] can be an appropriate methodology in this respect: grounded on a “human- ', 'centred design ethos”, it advocates a “designer’s sensibility” pervading the whole organ¬ ', 'isation, so that also technical personnel (be it part of the development or of the manage¬ ', 'ment) can be aware of the importance of meeting users’ needs with what is technolog¬ ', 'ically feasible. Inspired by design thinking, the organisational culture is likely to ', 'empathise more with the user and to share the ownership of the UX vision among all ', 'members of the company: this is in turn also likely to address the task ownership theme ', 'introduced above. ', '', 'However, the benefits of this internal culture may be limited if the customer does ', 'not share its same values, preventing access to users or completely mediating the ', 'communication with them. A direct contact with users can allow the company to deliver ', 'a product that, although requiring a possibly longer design period, will be more suited ', 'to the needs of people ultimately using it and will therefore bring more value to the ', 'customer for its money. Even after many years from [23], we still need to address the ', '', '', 'Focal Points for a More User-Centred Agile Development ', '', '', '13 ', '', '', '“developer mindset” [1, 14] and persuade the customer and the technical personnel (at ', 'least partially) of the positive cost-benefit trade-off of devoting time to user studies and ', 'usability [32]. We insist that attainable benefits should be clearly presented to the ', 'customer in order to win its buy-in of the principles of design thinking, its acknowl¬ ', 'edgement of the advantages of involving the users and its active collaboration in this. ', 'We point out to the research community that however, to this end, a set of actionable ', 'measures that can more objectively assess the positive impact of user involvement on ', 'the quality of produced software [18] is still lacking, together with a set of less resource¬ ', 'intensive practices to put such involvement in place.

Many tools have been created for measuring the agility of ', 'software teams, thus creating a saturation in the field. Three agile mea¬ ', 'surement tools were selected in order to validate whether they yield sim¬ ', 'ilar results. The surveys of the tools were given to teams in Company ', 'A (N = 30). The questions were grouped into agile practices which ', 'were checked for correlation in order to establish convergent validity. In ', 'addition, we checked whether the questions identified to be the same ', 'among the tools would be given the same replies by the respondents. ', 'We could not establish convergent validity since the correlations of the ', 'data gathered were very few and low. In addition, the questions which ', 'were identified to have the same meaning among the tools did not have ', 'the same answers from the respondents. We conclude that the area of ', 'measuring agility is still immature and more work needs to be done. Not ', 'all tools are applicable to every team but they should be selected on the ', 'basis of how a team has transitioned to agile.

Although it has been almost 20 years since the former ', 'were introduced, the companies are quite reluctant in following them [1]. ', '', 'Software development teams started adopting the most known agile method¬ ', 'ologies, such as eXtreme Programming [2], Feature Driven Development (FDD), ', '[3], Crystal [4], Scrum [5] and others. Most companies use a tailored methodology ', 'by following some of the aforementioned processes and practices which better ', 'suit their needs. Williams et al. [6] report that all XP practices are exercised ', 'rarely in their pure form, something on which Reifer [7] and Aveling [8] also ', 'agree based on the results of their surveys, which showed that it is common for ', 'organizations to partially adopt XP. The most important issue that tends to be ', 'neglected though, is how well these methodologies are adopted. ', '', '', '© The Author(s) 2016 ', '', 'H. Sharp and T.

The previous statement is also supported ', 'by Taromirad and Ramsin [10], who argue that the agile software development ', 'methodologies are often applied to the wrong context. Sidky [11] defines the level ', 'of agility of a company as the amount of agile practices used. Considering this ', 'statement, a group that uses pair programming and collective code ownership ', 'at a very low level is more agile than a group which uses only pair programming ', 'but in a more efficient manner. ', '', 'Williams et al. [12] pose the question u How agile is agile enough ”? Accord¬ ', 'ing to a survey conducted by Ambysoft [13], only 65% of the agile companies ', 'that answered met the five agile criteria posed in the survey. Poonacha and ', 'Bhattacharya [14] mentioned that the different perceptions of agile practices ', 'when they are adopted are troublesome, since even people in the same team ', 'understand them differently, according to the result of a survey [15]. ', '', 'Since agile methodologies become more and more popular, there is a great need ', 'for developing a tool that can measure the level of agility in the organizations that ', 'have adopted them. For over a decade, researchers have been constantly coming ', 'up with models and frameworks in an effort to provide a solution. ', '', 'This case study comprises three tools which claim to measure the agility of ', 'software development teams using surveys. These tools are Perceptive Agile Mea¬ ', 'surement (PAM) [16], Team Agility Assessment (TAA) [17], Objectives Princi¬ ', 'ples Strategies (OPS) [18]. The first one has been validated with a large sample of ', 'subjects, the second one is well-used by companies and the third one covers many ', 'agile practices. Since all three tools measure agility, convergent validity should ', 'be established among them to corroborate this. The surveys from the three tools ', 'were given to Company A employees to answer. The analysis of the data was per¬ ', 'formed by grouping the survey questions in accordance to to agile practices. The ', 'correlation of these practices were the indications for establishing the convergent ', 'validity. Moreover, questions identified to have the same meaning among the tools ', 'should have the same answers from the respondents. The purpose of this study is ', 'to check whether these three tools will yield similar results. ', '', 'Research Questions. ', '', '1. Will PAM, TAA and OPS yield similar results? ', '', '(i) Does convergent validity exist between the tools? ', '', '(ii) Will the questions that are exactly the same in the tools yield the same ', 'results? ', '', '2 Case Study ', '', 'Any effort to see if the selected agility measurement tools are valid in what they ', 'do, would require to apply them to real software developments teams. According ', 'to Runeson and Host [19], a case study is “a suitable research methodology for ', 'software engineering research since it studies contemporary phenomena in their ', 'natural context”. As a result, a case study was selected as the most suitable ', '', '', 'means. ', '', '', '18 ', '', '', 'K. Chronis and L. Gren ', '', '', '2.1 Subject Selection ', '', 'Company A is a United States company which operates in the Point Of Sales ', '(POS) area. It has four teams with mixed members of developers and testers. ', 'The teams do not follow a specific agile methodology, but rather a tailored mix ', 'of the most famous ones which suits the needs of each team. Methodology A, ', 'as we can name it, embraces the practices from the various agile methodologies, ', 'some of them to a larger and some of them to a smaller extent. The analysis ', 'process created by Koch [20] was used for identifying these methodologies. The ', 'identification of the practices was done by observing and understanding how the ', 'teams work. ', '', '2.2 Data Collection ', '', 'In order to collect the data, an online survey was considered to be the best ', 'option, since it could be easily answered by each subject. ', '', 'For each of the tools, four surveys were created (one for each team). The ', 'data collection lasted about one month, while the surveys for each tool were ', 'conducted every ten days. None of the subjects was familiar with any of the ', 'tools. ', '', 'Two subjects were requested to answer to the surveys first, in order to detect ', 'if there were any questions which could cause confusion, but also to see how ', 'much time is needed to complete a survey. Once the issues pointed out by the ', 'two subjects were fixed, the surveys were sent to the rest of the company’s ', 'employees. ', '', 'The links for the surveys were sent to the subjects via email, and they were ', 'asked to spend 15-20 min to reply to the survey. The employees who belonged ', 'to more than one team were asked a couple of days later to take the other survey ', 'in order to verify that their answers matched in both surveys. ', '', 'OPS agility measurements are based on three aspects: Adequacy, Capability ', 'and Effectiveness. Effectiveness measurement focuses on how well a team imple¬ ', 'ments agile methodologies. Since the rest of the tools focus on the same thing, ', 'it was decided only to use the survey from Effectiveness and not to take into ', 'account the Adequacy and Capability aspects. ', '', 'The surveys for PAM, TAA and OPS were answered on a Likert scale 1-7 ', '(never having done what is asked in the question to always doing what is asked ', 'in the question). ', '', 'The employees who were asked to answer to the surveys were all members of ', 'the software development teams, which consisted of software and QA engineers. ', 'All of the participating employees have been in the company for over a year ', 'and most of them have more than five years of work experience in an agile ', 'environment. Employees who had been working for less than six months in the ', 'company were not asked to participate, since it was considered that they were ', 'not fully aware of the company’s procedures or that they were not familiar ', 'enough with them. Each participant replied to 176 questions in total. Initially, ', '34 surveys were expected to be filled in, but in the end, 30 of them were filled ', 'in, since some employees chose not to participate. ', '', '', 'Agility Measurements Mismatch ', '', '', '19 ', '', '', '2.3 Data Preparation ', '', 'All three tools have different amount of questions and cover different practices. ', 'For this reason, we preferred to do a grouping of the questions based on the ', 'practices/areas to which they belong. ', '', 'Team Agility Assessment - Areas. Team Agility Assessment (TAA) does not ', 'claim that it covers specific agile practices, but rather areas important for a ', 'team. It focuses on product ownership for Scrum teams but also on the release, ', 'iteration planning and tracking. The team factor plays a great role, as well as ', 'the development practices and the work environment. Automated testing and ', 'release planning are important here as well.

The Perceptive Agile Measurement ', '(PAM) tool focuses on the iterations during software development, but also on ', 'the stand-up meetings for the team members, their collocation and the retro¬ ', 'spectives they have. The access to customers and their acceptance criteria have a ', 'high importance as well. Finally, the continuous integration and the automated ', 'unit testing are considered crucial in order to be agile. ', '', 'Objectives, Principles, Strategies (OPS) - Practices. Objectives, Principles, ', 'Strategies (OPS) Framework is the successor of the Objectives, Principles, Prac¬ ', 'tices (OPP) Framework [21]. OPP identified 27 practices as implementations of ', 'the principles which later on were transformed into 17 strategies. ', '', 'Practices Covered Among The Tools. We have abstracted some of the OPP prac¬ ', 'tices to OPS strategies in order to avoid repeating the mapping of the questions. ', 'The connection between the practices and the strategies is done based on the ', 'questions of each tool. ', '', 'Mapping of questions among tools. PAM has its questions divided on the basis of ', 'agile practices, while on the other hand, TAA has divided them based on areas ', 'considered important. Although all practices/areas from PAM and TAA are ', 'mapped onto OPP and OPS, not all of their questions are under OPP practices ', 'or OPS strategies. This can be explained due to the different perception/angle ', 'that the creators of the tools have and what is considered important for an ', 'organization/team to be agile. ', '', '', '2.4 Data Analysis ', '', 'The data gathered from the surveys were grouped on the basis of the practices ', 'covered by the OPP, and as a consequence, the OPS. ', '', 'Convergent Validity Analysis. Since all the tools claim to be measuring agility ', 'and under the condition that convergent validity exists among them, then, by ', 'definition, they should yield similar results. ', '', '', '20 ', '', '', 'K. Chronis and L. Gren ', '', '', 'In similar studies [22,23], the correlation analysis was selected as the best way ', 'to check similar tools and this was followed here as well. We decided to use the ', 'practices covered by each tool and see if they correlate with the same practices ', 'from the other two tools. The idea is based on the multitrait-multirnethod matrix , ', 'presented by Campbell and Fiske [24]. The matrix is the most commonly used ', 'way for providing construct validity. ', '', 'In order to select which correlation analysis method to choose from, the ', 'data were checked if they had normal distribution by using the Shapiro-Wilk ', 'test which is the most powerful normality test, according to a recent paper ', 'published by Razali and Wah [25]. The chosen alpha level was 0.05, as it is the ', 'most common one. ', '', 'Out of the 42 normality checks (three for each of the 14 practices), only ', '17 concluded that the data are normally distributed. The low level of normally ', 'distributed data gave a strong indication that Spearman’s rank correlation coef¬ ', 'ficient, which is more adequate for non-parametric data, was more appropriate ', 'to use, rather than the Pearson’s product-moment correlation. ', '', 'In order to use the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, a monotonic rela¬ ', 'tionship between two variables is required. In order to check for the monotonicity, ', 'plots were drawn between the results of each tool for all 14 practices. The plots ', 'surprisingly showed that only eight out of 42 were monotonic, which indicates ', 'no correlation what-so-ever. ', '', 'Direct Match Questions Analysis. We want to find which questions are the same ', 'among the tools. In order to achieve this, the mapping described in Subsect. 2.3 ', 'was used. Afterward, the questions were checked one by one to identify the ones ', 'which had the same meaning. When we finalized the groups of questions which ', 'were the same, we requested from the same employees who were taking the pilot ', 'surveys to verify if they believed the groups were correctly formed. Their answer ', 'was affirmative, so we continued by checking if the answers of the subjects were ', 'the same. Surprisingly, OPS-TAA have 20 questions with the same meaning, ', 'while OPS-PAM and TAA-PAM only four and three respectively. ', '', 'Out of the 35 normality checks (two for each group and three for one group), ', 'only 2 concluded that the data are normally distributed. Since the samples are ', 'also independent (they do not affect one another), there is a strong indication ', 'that the MannWhitney U test is appropriate. For the group Smaller And Fre¬ ', 'quent Product Releases , we used the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance ', 'method, which is the respective statistical method for more than two groups. ', '', 'The hypothesis in both cases was: ', '', 'Hq: There is no difference between the groups of the same questions ', 'Hi: There is a difference between the groups of the same questions ', '', '3 Results ', '', '3.1 Correlations ', '', 'As it was previously stated, only eight out of 42 plots were monotonic. The ', 'more interesting than the correlations result is the non-existence of monotonicity ', '', '', 'Agility Measurements Mismatch ', '', '', '21 ', '', '', 'in the other 34 relationships, which leads us to the conclusion that there is ', 'little convergence among the tools. This is surprising because tools claiming to ', 'measure the same thing should converge. ', '', '', '3.2 Direct Match Questions Results ', '', 'The groups of direct match questions showed some unexpected results. Questions ', 'which are considered to have the same meaning should yield the same results, ', 'which was not the case for any of the question groups, apart from one group ', 'concerning the Software Configuration Management. On the other hand, the ', 'Product Backlog practice had the lowest score with only six respondents giving ', 'the same answer. The maximum difference in answers was up to two Likert-scale ', 'points. ', '', 'As far as the results from the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis one¬ ', 'way analysis of variance are concerned, the p-values from the majority of the ', 'groups are more than the alpha level of 0.05. As a result, we cannot reject the ', 'Hq hypothesis. Such practices are Iteration Progress Tracking and Reporting - ', 'group #2, High-Bandwidth Communication and others. On the other hand, the ', 'p- value of group Software Configuration Management cannot be computed, since ', 'all the answers are the same, while for other groups the p- value is below the alpha ', 'level which means that the Hq hypothesis can be rejected. Such practices are ', 'Continuous Integration - group #2, Iteration Progress Tracking and Reporting - ', 'group #4 and others. ', '', '4 Discussion ', '', '4.1 Will PAM, TAA and OPS Yield Similar Results? ', '', 'The plots drawn by the data gathered showed an unexpected and interesting ', 'result. Not only do the tools lack a correlation, but they do not even have a ', 'monotonic relationship when compared to each other for the agile practices cov¬ ', 'ered, resulting in absence of convergent validity. This could indicate two things; ', 'the absence of monotonicity and the negative or very low correlations show that ', 'the questions used by the tools in order to cover an agile practice do it differently ', 'as well as that PAM, TAA and OPS measure the agility of software development ', 'teams in their own unique way. ', '', 'Almost all groups had different responses to the same questions. With ', 'regards to the research question “Does convergent validity exist among ', 'the tools?”, we showed that convergent validity could not be established due ', 'to the low (if existing) correlations among the tools. Concerning the research ', 'question “Will the questions that are exactly the same among the tools ', 'yield the same results?”, we saw that a considerable amount of respondents’ ', 'answers were different. ', '', 'The reasons for this somewhat unexpected results are explained in the ', 'following paragraphs. ', '', '', '', '22 ', '', '', 'K. Chronis and L. Gren ', '', '', 'Few or no questions for measuring a practice. A reason for not being able to ', 'calculate the correlation of the tools is that they cover slightly or even not at all ', 'some of the practices. An example of this is the Smaller and Frequent Product ', 'Releases practice. OPS includes four questions, while on the other hand, PAM ', 'and TAA have a single question each. Furthermore, Appropriate Distribution of ', 'Expertise is not covered at all by PAM. In case the single question gets a low ', 'score, this will affect how effectively the tool will measure an agile practice. On ', 'the contrary, multiple questions can better cover the practice by examining more ', 'factors that affect it. ', '', 'The same practice is measured differently. Something interesting that came up ', 'during the data analysis was that although the tools cover the same practices, ', 'they do it in different ways, leading to different results. An example of this is the ', 'practice of Refactoring. PAM checks whether there are enough unit tests and ', 'automated system tests to allow the safe code refactoring. In case the course ', 'unit/system tests are not developed by a team, the respondents will give low ', 'scores to the question, as the team members in Company A did. Nevertheless, ', 'this does not mean that the team never refactors the software or does it with ', 'bad results. All teams in Company A choose to refactor when it adds value to ', 'the system, but the level of unit tests is very low and they exist only for specific ', 'teams. On the other hand, TAA and OPS check how often the teams refactor, ', 'among other aspects. ', '', 'The same practice is measured in opposite questions. The Continuous Integra¬ ', 'tion practice has a unique paradox among TAA, PAM and OPS. The first ', 'two tools include a question about the members of the team having synchro¬ ', 'nized to the latest code, while OPS checks for the exact opposite. According to ', 'Soundararajan [18], it is preferable for the teams not to share the same code in ', 'order to measure the practice. ', '', 'Questions phrasing. Although the tools might cover the same areas for each ', 'practice, the results could differ because of how a question is structured. An ', 'example of this is the Test Driven Development practice. Both TAA and PAM ', 'ask about automated code coverage, while OPS just asks about the existence of ', 'code coverage. Furthermore, TAA focuses on 100 % automation, while PAM does ', 'not. Thus, if a team has code coverage but it is not automated, then the score of ', 'the respective question should be low. In case of TAA, if the code coverage is not ', 'fully automated, its score should be even lower. It is evident that the abstraction ', 'level of a question has a great impact. The more specific it is, the more a reply ', 'to it will differ, resulting in possible low scores. ', '', 'Better understanding of agile concepts. In pre-post studies there is a possibility ', 'of the subjects becoming more aware of a problem in the second test due to ', 'the first test [26]. Although the testing threat, as it is called, does not directly ', 'apply here, the similar surveys on consecutive weeks could have enabled the ', 'respondents to take a deeper look into the agile concepts, resulting in better ', 'understanding of them, and consequently, providing different answers to the ', 'surveys’ questions. ', '', '', 'Agility Measurements Mismatch ', '', '', '23 ', '', '', 'How people perceive agility. Although the concept of agility is not new, people ', 'do not seem to fully understand it, as Conboy and Wang [27] also mention. This ', 'is actually the reason behind the existence of so many tools in the field which ', 'are trying to measure how agile the teams are or the methodologies used. The ', 'teams implement agile methodologies differently and researchers create different ', 'measurement tools. There are numerous definitions of what agility is [28-31], ', 'and each of the tool creators adopt or adapt the tools to match their needs. ', 'Their only common basis is the agile manifesto and its twelve principles [32], ', 'which are (and should be considered as) a compass for the agile practitioners. ', 'Nevertheless, they are not enough and this resulted in the saturation of the field. ', 'Moreover, Conboy and Fitzgerald [33] state that the agile manifesto principles ', 'do not provide practical understanding of the concept of agility. Consequently, ', 'all the reasons behind the current survey results are driven by the way in which ', 'tool creators and tool users perceive agility. ', '', 'The questions in the surveys were all based on how their creators perceived ', 'the agile concept which is quite vague, as Tsourveloudis and Valavanis [34] have ', 'pointed out. None of the Soundararajan [18], So and Scholl [16], Leffingwell [17] ', 'claimed, of course, to have created the most complete measurement tool, but ', 'still, this leads to the oxymoron that the tools created by specialists to measure ', 'the agility of software development teams actually do it differently and without ', 'providing substantial solution to the problem. On the contrary, this leads to ', 'more confusion for the agile practitioners. ', '', 'Considering that the researchers and specialists in the agile field perceive the ', 'concept of agility differently, it would be naive to say that the teams do not ', 'do the same. The answers to surveys are subjective and people reply to them ', 'depending on how they understand them. Ambler [15] stated the following: “I ', 'suspect that developers and management have different criteria for what it means ', 'to be agile”. This is also corroborated by the fact that, although a team works ', 'in the same room and follows the same processes for weeks, it is rather unlikely ', 'that its members will have the same understanding of what a retrospection or a ', 'releasing planning meeting means to them, a statement which is also supported ', 'by Murphy et al. [35]. ', '', '5 Threats to Validity ', '', '5.1 Construct Validity ', '', 'We consider that the construct validity concerning the surveys given to the ', 'subjects was already handled by the creators of the tools which were used. Our ', 'own construct validity lies in establishing the convergent validity. The small ', 'sample of subjects was the biggest threat in establishing convergent validity, ', 'making the results very specific to Company A itself. Future work on this topic ', 'should be performed at other companies to mitigate this threat. In order to ', 'avoid mono-method bias, some employees were asked to fill in the surveys first ', 'in order to detect any possible issues. All the subjects were promised to remain ', 'anonymous, resulting in mitigating the evaluation apprehension [36]. ', '', '', '24 ', '', '', 'K. Chronis and L. Gren ', '', '', '5.2 Internal Validity ', '', 'The creators of PAM, TAA and OPS have already tried to mitigate internal valid¬ ', 'ity when creating their tools. Yet, there are still some aspects of internal validity, ', 'such as selection bias maturation and testing effect. With regard to maturation, ', 'this concerns the fatigue and boredom of the respondents. Although the surveys ', 'were small in size and did not require more than 15-20 min each, still the similar ', 'and possibly repetitive questions on the topic could cause fatigue and boredom ', 'to the subjects. This could result in the participants giving random answers to ', 'the survey questions. The mitigation for this threat was to separate the surveys ', 'and conduct them during three different periods. In addition, the respondents ', 'could stop the survey at any point and continue whenever they wanted. As far ', 'as the testing effect is concerned, this threat could not be mitigated. The testing ', 'effect threat applies to pre-post design studies only, but due to the same topic ', 'of the surveys, the subjects were to some extent more aware of what questions ', 'to expect in the second and third survey. Finally, selection could also not be ', 'mitigated, since the case study focused on a specific company only. ', '', '', '5.3 Conclusion Validity ', '', 'Although the questions of the surveys have been carefully phrased by their cre¬ ', 'ators, still there may be uncertainty about them. In order to mitigate this, for ', 'each survey a pilot one was conducted to spot any questions which would be ', 'difficult to understand. In addition, the participants could ask the first author ', 'about any issue they had concerning the survey questions. Finally, the statistical ', 'tests were run only for the data that satisfied the prerequisites, with the aim to ', 'mitigate the possibility of incorrect results. ', '', '', '5.4 External Validity ', '', 'This case study was conducted in collaboration with one company and 30 sub¬ ', 'jects only. Consequently, it is hard to generalize the outcomes. Nevertheless, we ', 'believe that any researcher replicating the case study in another organization ', 'with teams which follow the same agile practices as those used in Company A ', 'would get similar results. ', '', '', '5.5 Reliability ', '', 'To enable other researchers to conduct a similar study, the steps followed have ', 'been described and the reasons for the decisions made have been explained. ', 'Furthermore, all the data exist in digital format which can be provided to anyone ', 'who wants to review them. The presentation of the findings could probably be ', 'a threat to validity because of the first author’s experience at the company. In ', 'order to mitigate this, the findings were discussed with a Company A employee ', 'who did not participate in the case study.

One of the benefits of agile is close collaboration of customer and ', 'developer. This ensures good commitment and excellent knowledge flows of ', 'information about priorities and efforts. However, it is unclear if this benefit can ', 'be leveraged at scale. Clearly, it is infeasible to use practices such as planning ', 'game with several agile teams in the room. In this paper, we investigate how a ', 'large-scale agile organization manages, what challenges exist, and which oppor¬ ', 'tunities can be leveraged. We found challenges in three areas: (i) the ability to ', 'estimate, prioritize, and plan; (ii) the context of planning with respect to working ', 'environment, team build-up, and team spirit; and (iii) the ceremonial agreement ', 'which promises to allow leveraging abilities in a given context.

Popular agile methods such as Scrum [18] and extreme Programming (XP) ', '[17] have powerful planning mechanisms in place, around practices such as backlog ', 'grooming, distinction between product and sprint backlog, and defining Sprint goals in ', 'Scrum, or user stories, onsite customer, acceptance testing, and planning game in XP.

In this paper we present a qualitative case study based on ten semi- ', 'structured interviews that explores how program and project leaders, product owners, ', 'line managers, and developers of cross-functional teams coordinate around planning ', 'work in a large-scale agile setting. ', '', 'Contribution. Our contribution in this paper is two-fold. First, we provide insights ', 'about the challenges of aligning the views of product owners and product developers ', 'during planning in large-scale agile. Secondly, we provide a model on the relationship ', 'of different challenge types that shows how technical abilities (e.g. to estimate, to priori¬ ', 'tize, or to plan) depend on contextual aspects (such as team build-up, work environment, ', 'and team spirit). Our study indicates that ceremony agreement plays a crucial role for ', 'enabling technical abilities of estimation, prioritization, and planning in a given context ', 'defined by the team structure and its environment. ', '', '', '2 Background and Related Work ', '', 'Agile software development is incremental, cooperative, and adaptive [6] and facilitates ', 'responding to change quickly and frequently [8]. According to Leffingwell [1] it leads ', 'to the following business benefits: increase in productivity, increase in team morale and ', 'job satisfaction, faster time to market, and increase in quality. In this paper, we refer to ', 'the agile methods Scrum and XP [1,8] and we are inspired by the XP practice Planning ', 'Game, wich suggest that developers, managers, and customers meet at the start of each ', 'iteration to estimate and prioritize requirements (user stories) for the next release [6, 8]. ', '', 'Agile methods rely heavily on face-to-face communication [3, 5, 9]. However, if the ', 'number of the involved developers (and teams) grows, it becomes extremely difficult to ', 'practice face-to-face communication between different teams [3, 5, 9]. Such growth is ', 'usually triggered by a large number of complex requirements and there is a considerable ', 'challenge to manage them [3, 4]. While Larman and Vodde suggest the use of area ', 'product owners to scale the product owners role [2], Lassenius and Paavi report that ', 'collaboration and communication between teams and product owners in such a setup ', 'were challenging and did not work well [4]. These challenges are related to the fact that ', 'area product owners work with different teams and that teams could receive different ', 'user stories from several area product owners, which thereby become difficult to priori¬ ', 'tize [4]. Also, the introduction of Scrum of Scrums meeting (SoS- a meeting where the ', 'Scrum masters of all Scrum teams meet on a daily or weekly basis to discuss the state ', 'of every team) was found to be ineffective because of the large number of Scrum masters ', 'that were involved. As a consequence of this large audience, it was difficult to get ', 'everybody interested in the coordination meetings [4]. ', '', 'Products with long lifecycle (e.g. complex systems like ships or planes) tend to have ', 'very comprehensive backlogs [20]. According to Larman and Vodde, it is the respon¬ ', 'sibility of the product owner to prioritize the product backlog to improve return on ', 'investment or delivery of value [20] . For this, they suggest using planning poker to assign ', 'effort and relative value points (RVP) as a lightweight proxy for ‘value’ (e.g. on a scale ', 'of 1-7). The product owner then prioritizes items based on low effort estimate and high ', '', '', '30 ', '', '', 'F. Evbota et al. ', '', '', 'RVP as well as other factors, such as stakeholders’ preferences, strategic alignment, ', 'impact on profit, and risk [20]. Daneva et al. describe requirements prioritization in ', 'large-scale agile software development as a decision-making process [19]. In this ', 'process, priority drives the packaging of requirements into releases: requirements with ', 'highest priorities are packaged for development first [13] and usually the main criterion ', 'for such prioritization is the business value of clients and vendors [19]. Agile develop¬ ', 'ment however implies incremental development prioritization, which is hard to main¬ ', 'tain: Priorities of requirements change, so there is always a need to update the priority ', 'list [13]. Thus, for being able to carry out a successful decision in prioritization, it is of ', 'paramount importance to continuously consider the roles involved, the contextual setting ', 'of the prioritization process, the prioritization criteria being used, and the kind of trade¬ ', 'offs being made [19]. Yet, according to Daneva et at. [19], there is a lack of (empirical) ', 'knowledge about how requirements prioritization is done in large-scale agile software ', 'development [19], a gap that we aim at exploring in this paper. ', '', '3 Research Method ', '', 'The setting for this case study is Ericsson AB in Gothenburg, Sweden. Ericsson was ', 'founded in the year 1876 and is a world leading Swedish telecommunication company. ', 'Ericsson has its headquarter in Stockholm in Sweden and has more than 110, 000 ', 'employees from different parts of the world such as Sweden, China, United States of ', 'America, South Africa, United Kingdom, Germany, Nigeria, and other countries. ', 'Ericsson is involved in the development of several products, such as, cable TV, network ', 'systems, Internet Protocol, networking equipment, video systems, mobile, and fixed ', 'broadband. Ericsson also renders extensive services to its customers. Ericsson uses agile ', 'methods at a large-scale in development of their products and their methods include for ', 'example Scrum, Extreme programming, and Kanban. ', '', 'This paper presents a case study conducted at Ericsson in which we explore collab¬ ', 'oration challenges during planning of large-scale agile development efforts. We choose ', 'a qualitative case study approach that allows studying large-scale agile planning in its ', 'context [12, 15, 16]. Accordingly, we selected ten participants based on their ability in ', 'order to cover the following roles: operative product owner (OPO), line manager, ', 'program leader, project leader, release leader, team leader and developer. Through this ', 'setup, we were able to investigate collaboration challenges between teams, product ', 'owners, and program leaders in large-scale agile software development in depth. Some ', 'of our participants have about 30 years of working experience at Ericsson. The inter¬ ', 'views were based on an interview guide with open-ended and probing questions [15]. ', 'The interview questions focus on the collaboration challenges that teams, operative ', 'product owners, and program leaders face while planning, estimating, prioritizing, and ', 'delivery of features/tasks both on the teams and program levels at Ericsson. ', '', 'We carried out a verbatim transcription of the interviews data that we collected and ', 'analyzed it qualitatively to form themes and identify patterns using the six steps ', 'suggested by Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis approach [11]: ', '', '', 'Scaling up the Planning Game: Collaboration Challenges ', '', '', '31 ', '', '', 'Step 1: Familiarizing with your data.

', '', 'Step 6: Producing the report. For this paper we further analyzed the themes to iden¬ ', 'tify key challenges of large-scale agile planning in order to present and discuss our ', 'findings. ', '', 'In our analysis we coded the interview data by taking our research question into ', 'consideration [11]. The analysis of the interview data was not linear, meaning that we ', 'did not always follow the suggested steps in their exact order. The analysis phase was ', 'instead recursive; meaning that while we were in Step 3 for example, we often had to ', 'revisit Step 2 and even Step 1. ', '', '4 Findings: Technical Abilities, Context, and Ceremonies ', '', 'Our research method resulted in a number of observations that can be arranged into ', 'seven major themes, as shown in Fig. 1 : The technical ability to estimate, prioritize , and ', 'plan , the context of planning in terms of team build-up, work environment , and team ', 'spirit , and finally the ceremony agreement that plays a key role in aligning technical ', 'abilities and context. In this section, we will describe our findings with respect to each ', 'of the themes before we will discuss relationships between the themes as well as their ', 'implications to research and practice in Sect. 5. ', '', '4.1 Technical Ability Challenges ', '', 'For adequate planning, agile teams (regardless of their scale) need to bring together the ', 'ability to estimate required work, prioritize it with respect to business value, and to ', 'combine this knowledge into a good plan for the coming iteration(s). At a large-scale, ', 'where a hierarchy of product owners manages backlog items for a large number of teams, ', 'we identify (communication) challenges in all three parts. ', '', '', '32 ', '', '', 'F. Evbota et al. ', '', '', '', 'Fig. 1 . Relevant themes of large-scale agile planning concern technical abilities as well as context ', 'of planning. Ceremony agreement plays a key role to connect both spheres. ', '', 'Estimation Ability. According to our interviewees, it is extremely challenging to make ', 'a long-term estimation (i.e. making estimates for several months) because of the amount ', 'of content (i.e. product backlog items) is too big. This experience has lead teams to ', 'become skeptical about estimation in general. In addition, the fast pace and large-scale ', 'leads to a significant amount of troubleshooting, which is hard to anticipate and impacts ', 'available resources during a sprint: ', '', '“[Previously we] estimated on available days in the sprint, that is not a good way because you ', '', 'do not include the unexpected things ” [OPO] ', '', 'Another challenge with estimation in large-scale agile is the need to monitor discus¬ ', 'sions during story estimation. Our interviewees reported that without systematic moni¬ ', 'toring of such discussions, they could go on in circles for hours without making signif¬ ', 'icant progress. ', '', 'In the context of cross-functional teams, an unstructured estimation session can also ', 'lead to a pathological situation, where team members should estimate tasks that do not ', 'fit their role , as for example shown by the following quote from one of our interviewees: ', '', '“[,Sometimes we have a] tester estimating design tasks and a designer estimating test tasks. It ', '', 'is important to know whose estimation should be looked at”. [Line manager] ', '', 'Most of our interviewees stated that they are not experts in estimation and the chal¬ ', 'lenges of large-scale agile estimation create a steep learning curve, especially for new ', 'team members. Estimation is based learning from past iterations and experience in the ', 'team. ', '', 'Prioritization Ability. Large-scale agile product development implies a more or less ', 'complex structure of product owners and backlogs on different levels (such as total ', 'product, product area, operational level). It is hard to establish a shared vision with so ', 'many stakeholders, leading to disagreements and continued discussions about priorities. ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Scaling up the Planning Game: Collaboration Challenges ', '', '', '33 ', '', '', '“The challenge is if you have a lot of small backlog you are not in control at all because if you ', 'have one common backlog and you decide on a program level, that is how we work [...] if not ', 'everything is visible on the common backlog program and only visible in the XFTs backlog then ', 'you maybe having a mismatch. ” [OPO] ', '', 'Such potential inconsistencies between different backlogs as well as lack of their ', 'transparency are a big challenge. According to our interviewees, prioritization deci¬ ', 'sions need to be done on the program level. In contrast, information that is only available ', 'in the local backlog of a cross-functional team cannot be accessed and taken into consid¬ ', 'eration. Thus, if significant information is only available on the team’s level and not ', 'visible on the program level, prioritization decisions cannot be optimal and mismatches ', 'will be the consequence. It is impossible to share all information (e.g. about decisions, ', 'new technology, dependencies) with other teams, product owners, and the whole organ¬ ', 'ization. It is also very hard to understand the significance of information on the team ', 'level for prioritization. This potential mismatch makes it hard for the program board to ', 'establish a prioritization that teams will follow. ', '', 'Planning Ability. Under the theme planning ability we discuss findings that either ', 'affect both estimation and prioritization, or that arise from translating estimations and ', 'prioritizations into a concrete plan. The planning ability in large-scale agile product ', 'development is according to our interviewees enabling to balance market priorities with ', 'the inflow of change requests and bug reports. Our interviewees mentioned two impor¬ ', 'tant goals: To be (i) less release-focused in their planning, thus supporting continuous ', 'deployment to customers, and (ii) to achieve a higher flexibility in their planning. For ', 'both goals, the existing challenges are impediments. Since the planning is so difficult in ', 'large-scale agile, there is resistance towards changing a plan or establishing it as a truly ', 'continuous activity. ', '', 'Unclear requirements , one of the major challenges in large-scale agile planning, ', 'affect both estimation and prioritization. Our interviewees reported to be challenged to ', 'gain knowledge about the underlying user needs of a feature. This includes a potential ', 'lack of experience and knowledge about new features, starting with the area product ', 'owner. ', '', 'Another challenge is the unclear role of operational product owners and our inter¬ ', 'viewees mention slightly different challenges in the two different products. In Product ', 'A, our interviewees expressed confusion about to what level teams should be involved ', 'in planning. In contrast, the responsibilities of operational product owners in Product B ', 'where clearer. They interacted quite naturally with informal leaders in the teams during ', 'planning, thus allowing involvement of the team, without distracting the team members ', 'too much from their development tasks. Accordingly, it is beneficial to share the plan ', 'with the whole team, without giving the team the formal responsibility to report on it. ', '', 'Interviewees in both products agreed that balancing the involvement of teams in ', 'large-scale agile planning is challenging and that it is crucial to find a good process for ', 'their involvement. It is difficult for teams to engage in long-term planning beyond the ', 'next 18 month and while this might be necessary for large-scale agile development, our ', 'interviewees indicated that the teams do not benefit from participating in such long-term ', 'planning and do not understand why their participation should be necessary. While such ', '', '', '', '34 ', '', '', 'F. Evbota et al. ', '', '', 'a long-term plan is interesting to program leaders, program managers, and to the product ', 'line, teams should focus on producing results and cut the lead-time. ', '', 'Finally, our interviews reveal technical dependencies as well as dependencies ', 'between hardware and software as a planning challenge. If known, they represent ', 'constraints on planning. However, often such technical dependencies are hidden, leading ', 'to duplicate work or waiting time. While such waste cannot fully be avoided during ', 'large-scale agile planning, approaches to mitigate its impact are needed. ', '', '4.2 Contextual Challenges ', '', 'In addition to the general ability to estimate, prioritize, and plan, our data also revealed ', 'a number of challenges with respect of the context of planning, including work envi¬ ', 'ronment , team build-up , and team spirit. ', '', 'Work Environment. The studied company arranges the work environment generally ', 'as open space , where different teams sit to carry out their daily work. While this facil¬ ', 'itates information flow between teams, one team’s daily meetings can disturb other ', 'teams , as for example shown in the following quote from one our interviews. ', '', '“. ..we have scrum meetings in open office space [...]. You kind of get disturbed when other teams ', 'are having their scrum meeting in the open setting. It is better [if] every team has their different ', 'rooms. “[Dev.] ', '', 'Another issue mentioned by our interviewees is that sometimes other team members ', 'disturb them by walking into their teams to ask for help. While this is important inter¬ ', 'team communication, by-passing the operative product owners can be problematic when ', 'it happens too often or on non-trivial issues. ', '', 'Team Build-Up. Capabilities and special knowledge of teams are crucial resource ', 'constraints for planning. According to our interviewees operative product owners and ', 'program leaders have specific views on the capabilities of the team. This can lead ', 'to additional pressure on teams, when they are expected to develop more than what ', 'they are capable of. Our interviewees pointed out that these different views on teams ', 'capability can lead to frustration, when teams feel they cannot live up to the demand ', 'of the operative product owner and the operative product owner feels maybe she has ', 'promised something to the area product owners and the teams cannot deliver what ', 'she has promised. ', '', 'A common practice is to move team members to other teams that require additional ', 'resources (such as special knowledge). Our interviewees indicate difficulties in finding ', 'candidates to be moved between teams. Also, they mention doubts about the effectivity ', 'of this practice, since the team member to be moved does not possess deep knowledge ', 'about the target team and their context. Our interviewees claimed that instead compe¬ ', 'tence broadening of established teams should be emphasized to address missing team ', 'capabilities. Such a solution of course implies a longer lead-time and our interviewees ', 'pointed out that it is challenging for them to learn new roles when they already are ', 'experts in other required roles. ', '', '', '', 'Scaling up the Planning Game: Collaboration Challenges ', '', '', '35 ', '', '', 'Team Spirit. Our interviewees described, how team spirit starts to grow when team ', 'members have worked together and functioned successfully for some time. As a result, ', 'removing or adding new members to the team might decrease the spirit that has already ', 'been established within the team. As discussed above, some times people have to be ', 'moved between teams to provide teams with required resources. According to our data, ', 'removing team members from an established team destabilizes its spirit, which has been ', 'built over the period of close teamwork. In addition to that, the team spirit in the receiving ', 'team can also be impacted. Teams and team members adopt agile methods in different ', 'ways and some engineers are less open for the agile mindset because they have used the ', 'traditional method for a very long time and are accustomed to it, which can further impact ', 'the spirit of agile teams. ', '', '4.3 Ceremonial Agreement ', '', 'In addition to technical abilities and context of planning, we discovered themes in our ', 'interview data that affect the room between those two domains: Ceremonial agreement ', 'allows a group of agile teams and product owners to align planning abilities with the ', 'teams’ context. Efficient and effective information flows are necessary for keeping every ', 'employee aware about important decisions. According to our interviewees, it is however ', 'challenging to share knowledge about decisions within the large development context ', 'due to a lack of suitable information channels. Our interviewees said that they do not ', 'get updated on what (other) teams are doing due to insufficient time. If a product owner ', 'is responsible for several teams and these teams have their stand-up meetings at the same ', 'time, he needs to decide. But also the opposite can happen, when a team or an operative ', 'product owner have to interact with two area product owners who are typically very ', 'busy. In this situation, it is impossible to have frequent face-to-face meetings with them, ', 'resulting in asynchronous communication via email and social media. Such communi¬ ', 'cation is not as effective as face-to-face communication and can result in long response ', 'times. ', '', 'Coordination meetings (such as scrum-of-scrum (SoS)) are a potential solution, but ', 'were also criticized as boring or too short by our interviewees. They pointed out that in ', 'most of the SoS meetings it is difficult to have a thorough discussion and arrive at a good ', 'conclusion. Most of the times they have to close the meetings when they get into inter¬ ', 'esting technical discussion. One OPO mentioned that such discussions in the meetings ', 'might not be interesting to ah participants. ', '', 'While it is important not to by-pass the operative product owner when communi¬ ', 'cating with the team, this also introduces some indirection, e.g. between release leaders ', 'and the team. This requires building trusted relationships between release engineer, ', 'operative product owner, and team. A lot of such communication is the consequence of ', 'inadequate anatomy of features, i.e. u the relation between different features and parts ', 'of features\", as one of our interviewees put it. With other words, the way features are ', 'split up and assigned to sprint backlogs leads to dependencies between teams and creates ', 'the challenge of inter-team communication and coordination within the larger product ', 'portfolio. We found senior developers and product owners to rely on their personal ', 'network to coordinate across program boundaries: ', '', '', '', '36 ', '', '', 'F. Evbota et al. ', '', '', '“.../have a colleague that works as [...] operative product owner in other program and we try ', 'to collaborate between the programs and to align features for the customers and user experi¬ ', 'ence”. [OPO] ', '', 'Thus, we conclude that typical agile ceremonies are well adopted locally within ', 'teams, but challenges remain largely on the levels of inter-team and inter-product ', 'communication across a portfolio of products. ', '', '“The biggest challenge I pick is the coordination of the feature portfolio, [...] on top of getting ', 'out features in our program fast and efficient, we need to collaborate on a portfolio basis to ', 'align the features over two programs”. [OPO] ', '', 'Again, our findings resonate with Sauer’s recommendation to facilitate team spirit ', 'with opportunities for informal exchange, such as coffee breaks [14]. Ceremonial agree¬ ', 'ments should support large-scale agile planning in similar ways. ', '', '5 Discussion and Conclusion ', '', 'Implications for Practice. From a practical point of view, we see two main advantages: ', 'First of all, it is necessary to understand which different themes actually affect large ', 'scale agile planning. Too often too much effort is spend on shallow opinions, which then ', 'become the base for future actions. By having the seven different themes thoroughly ', 'understood, actions can be taken that lead towards true improvements. One example is ', 'the thorough understanding of the theme ‘Estimation Ability’ where a team needs a ', 'number of practices in place to be able to manage its velocity. Secondly, and likely even ', 'more important, it is necessary to understand how the different themes impact each other. ', 'For instance, once a team has understood its velocity and can estimate properly, they ', 'can be part of larger planning game among many teams, where in the end solid priori¬ ', 'tizations can be made in favor of having one complete release ready in time that matches ', 'a market request. Understanding these correlations between the themes helps industry ', 'to organize improvement initiatives in a way where it becomes obvious when there will ', 'be a true contribution to the product development. ', '', 'Implications for Research. Our main contribution in this paper is the model derived ', 'from our exploratory case study (summarized in Fig. 1). This model includes the insight ', 'that a large-scale agile organization’s ability of planning is not only depending on its ', 'teams’ abilities or skill, but also on the context in which those teams operate. Ceremonies ', 'and practices on inter-team and inter-product level are currently missing and invite ', 'further research. Our model gives an overview of key aspects of collaborative planning ', 'in large-scale agile development. And we hope that others find this overview useful to ', 'focus their research. In particular, we would encourage constructive research to provide ', 'improvement for one or several aspects. Our vision is a collection of best, or at least ', 'good, practices for each area in out model. ', '', 'Threats to Validity. We carefully reviewed the codes and themes generated by our ', 'research method, to ensure that our results are correctly derived from our data. It was ', 'beneficial, that we could bring both industrial and academic expertise together in these ', '', '', 'Scaling up the Planning Game: Collaboration Challenges ', '', '', '37 ', '', '', 'activities. Further, our qualitative investigation was carefully designed to align research ', 'method with research questions. Through reviews and pilot-interviews we made sure ', 'that participants of the study were able to understand and answer our questions, thus ', 'reducing the risk of misunderstanding and misinterpretation. Thus, we believe that we ', 'addressed internal and construct validity as well as reliability of the study in an adequate ', 'way. With our qualitative exploratory case study we did not aim for generalizability and ', 'external validity. Qualitative interviews and analysis are highly dependent on the ', 'researcher.

When understanding themes and their correlation thoroughly, it is vital to get ', 'practices in place that embrace speed and responsiveness. These are the two key elements ', 'in agile development.

How can we ', 'organize work environments that facilitate a higher degree of responsiveness? Which ', 'ceremonies can be used to speed up the complete planning process? How can the plan¬ ', 'ning process become more transparent? Are there any risks for planning too much? The ', 'potential of questions to continue to ask around large-scale agile planning is endless ', 'once the basic themes are understood and practiced to some level. ', '', 'Acknowledgements.

With agile teams becoming increasingly multi-disciplinary and ', 'including all functions, the role of customer feedback is gaining momentum. ', 'Today, companies collect feedback directly from customers, as well as indirectly ', 'from their products. As a result, companies face a situation in which the amount ', 'of data from which they can learn about their customers is larger than ever ', 'before. In previous studies, the collection of data is often identified as chal¬ ', 'lenging. However, and as illustrated in our research, the challenge is not the ', 'collection of data but rather how to share this data among people in order to ', 'make effective use of it. In this paper, and based on case study research in three ', 'large software-intensive companies, we (1) provide empirical evidence that Tack ', 'of sharing’ is the primary reason for insufficient use of customer and product ', 'data, and (2) develop a model in which we identify what data is collected, by ', 'whom data is collected and in what development phases it is used. In particular, ', 'the model depicts critical hand-overs where certain types of data get lost, as well ', 'as the implications associated with this. We conclude that companies benefit ', 'from a very limited part of the data they collect, and that lack of sharing of data ', 'drives inaccurate assumptions of what constitutes customer value.

Although the collection of customer ', 'feedback has always been important for R&D teams in order to better understand what ', 'customers want, it is today, when R&D teams are becoming increasingly ', 'multi-disciplinary to include all functions, that the full potential of customer data can be ', 'utilized [21]. In recent years, increasing attention has been put on the many different ', 'techniques that companies use to collect customer feedback. With connected products, ', '', '© The Author(s) 2016 ', '', 'H. Sharp and T. Hall (Eds.): XP 2016, LNBIP 251, pp. 39-52, 2016. ', '', 'DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-33515-5_4 ', '', '', '40 ', '', '', 'A.

', '', '', 'and trends such as ‘Big Data’ [1] and ‘Internet of Things’ [19], the qualitative tech¬ ', 'niques such as e.g. customer surveys, interviews and observations, are being com¬ ', 'plemented with quantitative logging and automated data collection techniques. For ', 'most companies, the increasing opportunities to collect data has resulted in rapidly ', 'growing amounts of data revealing contextual information about customer experiences ', 'and tasks, and technical information revealing system performance and operation. ', '', 'However, and as recognized in recent research [8], the challenge is no longer about ', 'how to collect data. Rather, the challenge is about how to make efficient use of the large ', 'volumes of data that are continuously collected and that have the potential to reveal ', 'customer behaviors as well as product performance [1, 6, 7, 9]. Although having access ', 'to large amounts of data, most companies experience insufficient use of the data they ', 'collect, and as a result weak impact on decision-making and processes. ', '', 'In this paper, we explore data collection practices in three large software-intensive ', 'companies, and we identify that Tack of sharing’ of data is the primary reason for ', 'insufficient use and impact of collected data. While the case companies collect large ', 'amounts of data from customers and from products in the field, they suffer from lack of ', 'practices that help them share data between people and development phases. As a ', 'result, decision-making and prioritization processes do not improve based on an ', 'accumulated data set that evolves throughout the development cycle, and organizations ', 'risk repetition of work due to lack of traceability. ', '', 'The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we identify that Tack of sharing’ is ', 'the primary reason for insufficient use of data and we provide empirical evidence on the ', 'challenges and implications involved in sharing of data in large software organizations. ', 'Second, and based on our empirical findings, we develop a model in which we identify ', 'what data is collected, by whom data is collected and in what development phases it is ', 'used. Our model depicts critical hand-overs where certain types of data get lost, and ', 'how this causes a situation where data does not accumulate and evolve throughout the ', 'development process. By capturing ‘current state-of-practice’, and by identifying ', 'critical hand-overs where data gets lost, the model supports companies in identifying ', 'what challenges they experience, and what implications this will result in. The ', 'awareness that the model helps create can work as valuable input when deciding what ', 'actions to take to improve sharing of data in large software-intensive organizations. ', '', '2 Background ', '', '2.1 Collection of Customer Feedback ', '', 'In most companies, customer feedback is collected on a frequent basis in order to learn ', 'about how customers use products, what features they appreciate and what function¬ ', 'ality they would like to see in new products [6, 5]. Typically, a wide range of different ', 'techniques are used to collect this feedback, spanning from qualitative techniques ', 'capturing customer experiences and behaviors [6, 7, 10], to quantitative techniques ', 'capturing product performance and operation [10-12]. While the qualitative techniques ', 'are used primarily in the early stages of development in order to understand the context ', 'in which the customer operates, the quantitative techniques are used post-deployment ', 'in order to understand the actual usage of products. ', '', '', 'The Lack of Sharing of Customer Data ', '', '', '41 ', '', '', 'Starting with the pre-development stage, companies typically collect qualitative ', 'customer feedback using customer journeys, interviews, questionnaires and surveys [6, ', '7], forming the basis for the requirements generation [13]. At this stage, contextual ', 'information on the purpose of the product or a feature with functional characteristics ', 'and means of use are typically collected by customer representatives. Typically, this ', 'information is used to both define functional requirements as well as to form customer ', 'groups with similar needs and priorities, also known as personas [17]. ', '', 'During development, customer feedback is typically collected in prototyping ses¬ ', 'sions in which customers test the prototype, discuss it with the developers and user ', 'experience (UX) specialists, and suggest modifications of e.g. the user interface [6, 7, ', '14], As a result, developers get feedback on product behaviors and initial performance ', 'data. Customer feedback is typically mixed and consists of both qualitative information ', 'on e.g. design decisions and quantitative operational data [6]. ', '', 'In the post-deployment stage, and when the product has been released to its cus¬ ', 'tomers, a number of techniques are used to collect customer and product data. First, and ', 'since the products are increasingly being connected to the Internet and equipped with ', 'data collection mechanisms, operational data, and data revealing feature usage is col¬ ', 'lected [6, 14, 15]. Typically, this data is of quantitative type and collected by the ', 'engineers that operate the product and service centers that support it. Second, if cus¬ ', 'tomers generate incident requests and attach the product log revealing the state of the ', 'product, error message and other details. These are important sources of information for ', 'the support engineers when troubleshooting and improving the product [10]. Also, and ', 'as recognized in previous research [15, 16], A/B testing is a commonly deployed ', 'technique to collect quantitative feedback in connected products on which version of ', 'the feature offers a better conversion or return of investment. And although increasing ', 'amounts of data are being collected, very little is actually being used. The challenges in ', 'aggregating and analyzing this data in an efficient way prevent higher levels of the ', 'organization from benefiting from it [12]. ', '', '', '2.2 Impact and Use of Customer Data ', '', 'Companies operating within transportation, telecommunications, retailing, hospitality, ', 'travel, or health care industries already today gather and store large amounts of ', 'valuable customer data [19]. These data, in combination with a holistic understanding ', 'of the resources needed in customer value-creating processes and practices, can provide ', 'the companies that fully utilize it a competitive advantage on the market [18]. ', '', 'However, challenges with meaningfully combining and analyzing these customer ', 'data in an efficient way are preventing companies from utilizing the full potential from ', 'it [1, 8]. Instead of a complete organization benefiting from an accumulated knowledge, ', 'it is mostly only the engineers and technicians that have an advantage in using this data ', 'for operational purposes [12]. Higher levels in the organization such as product ', 'management or customer relationship departments need to find ways of better utilizing ', 'customer data in order to unlock its potential and use it for prioritization and customer ', 'value-actualization processes [18].

Although these ', 'findings are occasionally presented at meetings, the lack of transparency and tools ', 'prevents others in the organization to use and benefit from the data. With so many ', 'different roles collecting and storing data, systematic sharing across development ', '', '', '', '', '', '46 ', '', '', 'A. Fabijan et al. ', '', '', 'phases becomes almost impossible. As a result, only those roles that work in close ', 'collaboration share data, and benefit from the analysis of this data. This situation is ', 'illustrated in the following quotes: ', '', '\"... it is all in my head more or less. ” -Product owner, Company B ', '', \"“Information exists but we don't know where it is. ”-UX Specialist from Company C \", '', '“I do not know everyone... So I contact only the person who is next in line. ” -Sales manager ', 'from Company C. ', '', '', '• Filtering of Customer Data ', '', 'People collect data, and share it only within the development stage they typically work ', 'in. For example, practitioners in the development phase actively exchange product log ', 'data, interaction design sketches, quality statistics and trouble reports. Similarly, those ', 'working in the post-deployment phase exchange release notes, business case descrip¬ ', 'tions and management system issues. Attempts to communicate the significance of ', 'customer feedback and their findings across development stages are typically unsuc¬ ', 'cessful. Feedback that is shared is filtered quantitative data. ', '', '“It is like there is a wall in-between. There is a tradition that we should not talk to each other. ” ', '-Product Owner from Company C. ', '', '• Arduous to Measure Means Hard to Share . ', '', 'The only data that is successfully shared among people and development phases, is ', 'quantitative data representing those things that can be easily measured such as e.g. ', 'system performance and operation. The case companies are successful in sharing ', 'transaction records, incident figures, feature usage data and other technical feedback ', 'that can be easily measured. However, qualitative data such as user stories, feature ', 'purpose, or the intention of a certain requirement typically stay with the people that ', 'collected that feedback. As a result, and instead of benefitting from an accumulated set ', 'of data that evolves over time, companies run the risk of using fragmented data sets that ', 'misrepresent the customer and provides an insufficient understanding of what consti¬ ', 'tutes customer value. ', '', '“Maybe 10 % of information is shared. It is very difficult. It takes so much time, to, you need to ', 'write a novel more or less and distribute it ” -Product manager from Company A. ', '', '', '4.3 Data Sharing Practices: Implications ', '', 'Due to very limited amounts of data being shared among people and across the ', 'development phases, the case companies experience a number of implications. Below, ', 'we present the implications: ', '', '', '', 'The Lack of Sharing of Customer Data ', '', '', '47 ', '', '', '• Non-evolving and Non-accumulating Data. ', '', 'Although quantitative data describing operational and performance requirements is ', 'typically shared, the lack of qualitative information with the context describing where, ', 'how and why a certain feature or a product is needed and how it will be used cause ', 'discrepancies in understanding the overall purpose. As a result, the data forming ', 'customer knowledge across the development stages does not accumulate and evolve. ', 'Consequently, practitioners developing the product do not fully understand the overall ', 'purpose of the product or a feature under development and develop suboptimal ', 'products that can be different from the customer wishes. ', '', '“I think now a lot of thing are developed in a sub optimized way. ” -Technology Spec, from ', 'company C. ', '', '“We get feature which is broken down and then this value somehow got lost when it was broken ', 'down, then it is harder to understand what they really need it for. ” -Software engineer from ', 'Company B. ', '', '• Repetition of Work. ', '', 'Due to the lack of access to the qualitative feedback that is collected in the early stages of ', 'development, roles in later stages that seek contextual understanding of a feature are ', 'sometimes required to collect identical feedback to the one that was already collected. ', 'Consequently, resources are spent on repeating the work that has already been done once. ', '', '“You cannot build on what is already there since you don ’t know. You then repeat an activity ', 'that was already made by someone else. ” -UX specialist from Company C. ', '', '', '• Inaccurate Models of Customer Value. ', '', 'Since the qualitative customer feedback is not shared across the development phases, ', 'companies risk to use only the available quantitative customer feedback to build or ', 'update the understanding of the customer. This results in inaccurate assumptions on ', 'what constitutes customer value. And as a consequence of using the feedback for ', 'prioritization on the product management level, projects that create waste risk to get ', 'prioritized. ', '', '“You think one thing is important but you don’t realize that there is another thing that was even ', 'more important. ” -Technology Spec, from company C. ', '', '', '• Validation of Customer Value is a (( Self-Fulfilling Prophecy ”. ', '', 'Due to the fact that only quantitative customer feedback is exchanged across the ', 'development phases and development organization, companies risk to validate their ', 'products using only the effortlessly quantifiable feedback, and neglecting the rest. ', 'Instead of using the accumulated customer feedback and holistically asses their ', 'products, the validation of customer value becomes a “self-fulfilling prophecy” in that ', 'it focuses on developing and verifying things that can be quantified and provide tan¬ ', 'gible evidence.

We represent a TDD cycle using a single glyph as shown ', 'in Fig. 1 [a]. This representation was inspired by hive plots [4] and encodes the ', 'nominal cycle data with a positional and color encoding (red=test, green=code, ', 'blue=refactor). The position of the segment redundantly encodes the TDD cycle ', 'phase (e.g. the red phase is always top right, the green phase is always at the ', 'bottom, and the blue phase is always top left).

They can also observe that the ', 'relationship between the time spent in each phase was fairly consistent. ', '', '', 'Snapshot Timeline. The snapshot timeline provides more information about ', 'the TDD process, specifically showing all the snapshots in the current session. ', 'An example snapshot timeline is shown in Fig. 1 [c]. The snapshot timeline con¬ ', 'sists of two parts, the snapshot classification bar (Fig. 1 [c] [1]) on the top, and the ', 'snapshot event timeline on the bottom (Fig. 1 [c] [2]). In the snapshot event time¬ ', 'line, each snapshot is represented with a rounded square. The color represents ', 'the outcome of the tests at that snapshot event. Red signifies the tests were run, ', 'but at least one test failed. If all the tests passed, then it is colored green. If the ', 'code and tests do not compile, we represent this with an empty white rounded ', 'box.

', '', 'The snapshot classification bar shows the cycle boundaries, and inside each ', 'cycle the ribbon of red, green and blue signifies which snapshot events fall into ', 'which phases. For example, in Fig. 1, snapshots 17-20 are all part of the same ', 'green phase. Snapshots 17-19 the developer is trying to get to a green, but they ', 'are not successful in making the tests pass until snapshot 20. ', '', 'This view answers questions specifically dealing with how consistent coders ', 'followed the TDD process, what snapshots were written by coders using the ', 'TDD process, and which ones were not. ', '', 'The snapshot timeline answers questions about identification. The timeline ', 'enables developers to identify which parts of the session conform to TDD and ', 'which do not. ', '', 'This view also allows the user to interactively select snapshots that are used ', 'to populate the code edit area (described below). To select a series of snapshots, ', 'the user interactively drags and resizes the gray selection box. In Fig. 1, snapshots ', '5 and 6 are selected. ', '', 'The snapshot timeline also answers questions dealing with comprehension. By ', 'seeing how TDD Viz catagorizes a snapshot, a user can determine why selected ', 'changes were made. For example, Fig. 1 shows a selected snapshot which represents ', 'the changes between snapshots numbers 5 and 6. Since the selected changes are part ', 'of a green phase (as noted by the green area in the Snapshot Classification Bar), ', '', '', 'TDDViz: Using Software Changes to Understand Conformance ', '', '', '57 ', '', '', 'a user can determine that these were production changes to make a failing test pass. ', 'This can be confirmed by observing the code edits. This encoding supports the same ', 'questions as the cycle plot and heartbeat arrangement, but, it does so at a finer ', 'granularity, showing each individual test run. ', '', '', 'TDD Code Edits. Figure 1 [d] shows an example of a code edit, which displays ', 'the changes to the code between two snapshots. To understand the TDD process, ', 'a coder must be able to look at the code that was written, and see how it evolved ', 'over time. By positioning the selection box on the timeline as described above, ', 'a user can view how all the code evolved over any two arbitrary snapshots. The ', 'code edit region contains an expandable and collapsable box for each file that ', 'was changed in the selected range of snapshots. Each box contains two code ', 'editors, one for the code at the selection’s starting snapshot, and one for the ', 'code at the ending snapshot. ', '', 'Whenever the user selects a new snapshot range, these boxes dynamically ', 'repopulate their content with the correct diffs.

This allows our infer- ', 'encer to determine which edits belong to the production code and which edits ', 'belong to the test code.

', '', 'The predicates take a snapshot and using the AST changes to the production ', 'and test code, as well as the result of the test runs, compute a boolean function. ', 'We compose several predicates to determine a transition to another state. For ', 'example: in order to transition from green to blue, the following conditions must ', 'hold true.

', '', 'The transition requires passing tests, because if not, the developer either ', 'remains in the green phase or has deviated from TDD.

In this paper ', 'we introduce the Minimum Viable User experience (MVUX) that aims at ', 'providing users a good enough user experience already in the early, minimal ', 'versions of the product. MVUX enables communication of the envisioned ', 'product value, gathering of meaningful feedback, and it can promote positive ', 'word of mouth. To understand what MVUX consists of, we conducted an ', 'interview study with 17 entrepreneurs from 12 small startups. The main ele¬ ', 'ments of MVUX recognized are Attractiveness, Approachability, Professional¬ ', 'ism, and Selling the Idea.

', '', '', '1 Introduction ', '', 'Global markets are being infiltrated by small startups with their innovative new ', 'products and business models. Software startups are characterized with scarce ', 'resources, little to none operating history, and time pressure [1]. One competitive ', 'advantage with startups compared to large organizations is their ability to move fast ', 'and adapt to changing circumstances [2]. However, as founding teams of startups often ', 'consist of only a few individuals, the team’s skills are naturally limited. For the same ', 'reason, the primary business objective of startups is to survive [3]. To survive, startups ', 'need to make the most out of their limited resources. Customer development [4] and ', 'Lean startup method [5], that have been widely adopted and taught by accelerators and ', 'entrepreneurship programs [6], emphasize gathering fast feedback from customers, and ', 'testing product ideas with minimal product versions or Minimum Viable Product ', '(MVP) as referred by Ries [5]. While Lean Startup has no scientific evidence for ', 'elfectiveness in business creation, the method is influencing how entrepreneurs ', 'approach product development [6, 7].

One challenge is that insufficient or disturbing user ', 'experience (UX) might reduce the user feedback and make the users concentrate ', 'mainly on the appearance of the user interface [8]. At the worst, poor UX can lead the ', 'user only to criticize the UX even if the product idea itself was good. [8] Benefits of ', 'delivering good UX from the earliest product version can be positive word of mouth ', 'advertisement [9], and users using the product for longer. ', '', 'The goal of this paper is to identify and structure the UX elements that are essential ', 'when building early product versions in small software startups. To understand the ', 'elements of desirable UX of early product versions, we introduce the concept and ', 'framework of Minimum Viable User experience that aims at providing UX that ', 'enables users to understand and gain value already from the early product versions. ', 'Correspondingly, startup is then able to collect more meaningful feedback from ', 'potential customers over a longer period of time since users do not abandon the ', 'product. ', '', 'In this paper, we report results of a two-phase interview study we conducted in ', 'Finland. In the first phase we interviewed 13 entrepreneurs from eight startups. All the ', 'startups were building, or had recently built, first versions of their products. Based on ', 'the analysis of these interviews, we created the initial MVUX framework. The ', 'framework is based on the assumption that MVUX is realized in the software being ', 'under development when (1) user can perform the core use cases to gain value, ', '(2) basic hygiene factors for usability and appearance are in place, and (3) the startup is ', 'able to get enough of feedback and data to validate and further develop the product ', 'idea. To evaluate the MVUX framework, we then interviewed four entrepreneurs of ', 'four more startups, all having expertise in UX. Through the interviews, we answer the ', 'following research questions: (1) what are the goals and key elements of MVUX from ', 'the startups’ perspective and (2) how can MVUX design framework help startups at the ', 'early phases of their product and business development. ', '', 'The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents related work on ', 'characteristics of software startups and their ways of working, and UX practices. ', 'Section 3 presents context and methods of our study. In Sect. 4 we present the results ', 'of our study including the UX elements considered important by startups, as well as the ', 'results of the evaluation of the MVUX framework. Section 5 discusses the results and ', 'Sect. 6 presents the conclusions for the paper. ', '', '2 Related Work ', '', '2.1 Characteristics of Software Startups ', '', 'Engineering and business concerns in software startups are more extensive than in ', 'established companies [2]. Those concerns include having scarce resources, being ', 'young and immature, operating with novel technologies in dynamic markets. Software ', 'startups are also influenced by divergent stakeholders such as investors, customers, ', 'partners, and competitors. [2] Also, customer-focused approach seems to be more ', 'crucial for small companies [2]: When the customer is happy with the software, it ', 'literally means more work and increased business opportunities for the small company ', '', '', '68 ', '', '', 'L. Hokkanen et al. ', '', '', 'as the happy customer wants more and is willing to recommend the software to others ', '[10]. Because of unestablished customer base, such positive word of mouth and ', 'keeping the existing customers satisfied is essential for startups. ', '', 'The professionalism of the entrepreneurs themselves often acts as a primary ', 'information source for startups due to unestablished stakeholder networks and cus¬ ', 'tomer base [3]. Moreover, people factors tend to be even more crucial for startups than ', 'for larger companies in the success or failure of the software [2]. Thus, the entrepreneur ', 'team is in a key role in keeping the startup focused and moving ahead [2]. For startups, ', 'short time to market is one of the most critical process goals [2]. Since a fundamental ', 'goal of a process is to describe the way an organization develops its software in a ', 'predictable and repeatable fashion, benefits of an established process do not meet ', 'essential needs of software startups [2, 3]. Therefore, startups require more informal ', 'and lightweight approaches. ', '', 'New entrepreneurial practices Customer development [4] and Lean startup method ', '[5] have been gaining attention in recent years. These practices emphasize that startups ', 'should concentrate on producing customer value and avoid wasteful activities, i.e. ', 'non-value adding activities. Although academic research on how well Customer ', 'development and the Lean startup method work is scarce, those methods have been ', 'widely adopted by incubators, accelerators and university entrepreneurship courses [6]. ', 'The Lean startup [5] suggests that by validating hypotheses of customer’s problems ', 'startups find a problem/solution fit that indicates there is business potential in solving a ', 'specific problem with a particular solution. Once the problem/solution fit is established, ', 'the startup should validate what product suites to deliver the solution. For finding ', 'validation, startups should build minimum viable products (MVP) that are then tested ', 'with potential customers. An MVP should be built with as little resources as possible ', 'yet it needs to enable testing the current hypothesis. Furthermore, Ries [5] emphasizes ', 'that the key performance indicators need to be measured when “getting out of the ', 'building” with the MVPs. From these experiments, startup should gain validated ', 'learning [5]. This Build-Measure-Learn (BML) cycle should be continued until a ', 'product/market fit is found and startups should also be prepared to discard the MVPs if ', 'they do not measure up to validating sustainable business opportunity [5]. ', '', '', '2.2 User Experience Work ', '', 'UX is defined as “a person’s perceptions and responses that result from the use or ', 'anticipated use of a product, system or service ” [11]. Also, UX is often divided into ', 'practical-oriented and hedonic dimensions [12]. The first dimension includes aspects ', 'related to ease of use, productivity, and usability while the latter concentrates on users’ ', 'emotions such as enjoyment and motivation. Regarding UX development in industry, ', 'companies in general tend to focus more on the practical qualities of UX while paying ', 'less attention to the hedonic ones [13]. ', '', 'UX design has roots in human-centered design (HCD) [11] that starts with thor¬ ', 'ough user research and design activities which are followed by design iterations. All in ', 'all, developing UX involves gaining understanding of the user and the context of use, ', 'designing and developing for good UX, and evaluating the resulting outcome [11]. ', '', '', 'Minimum Viable User Experience ', '', '', '69 ', '', '', 'While understanding users is considered important for startups [7], startups generally ', 'do not afford to follow rigorous methods for UX development. Research on UX ', 'development in startups is scarce. May [14] describes a case from applying lean ', 'methodology in a startup and recommends planning the UX activities in from early on. ', 'Klein [15] presents lightweight methods for UX work in lean startups. Finally, ', 'Hokkanen et al. [8] report that lack of UX expertise and time constrains hinder the ', 'startup from collecting useful feedback from users. ', '', '', '3 Methods, Research Context, and Participants ', '', '3.1 Course of the Study ', '', 'To address our research goal of understanding which UX factors are essential when ', 'building early product versions in startups, semi-structured interviews were chosen as ', 'the data gathering method. The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase ', 'we interviewed 13 entrepreneurs from 8 small startups in order to establish the MVUX ', 'framework. In the second phase, four entrepreneurs with UX expertise were inter¬ ', 'viewed to evaluate the created MVUX framework. Altogether, 12 interview sessions ', 'with 17 interviewees were conducted. All the interviews were conducted by one ', 'researcher and they lasted between 50-90 min. Interviews were audio recorded and ', 'transcribed for analysis. Participants were searched by going through Finnish startup ', 'incubator and accelerator programs. Some startups were recruited through directly ', 'contacting them based on their web page while others were recruited by advertising in ', 'the premises of one incubator program. ', '', 'In the first phase, eight semi-structured interviews were conducted to understand ', 'the early design decisions and UX goals in startups.

During the interviews, we introduced the general concept of ', 'MVUX to each interviewee. Participants were then asked to write down on a paper ', 'their goals and central elements for UX of their early product version intended to be ', 'deployed to users. Differences in UX goals between the earliest and complete product ', 'version were also shortly discussed. In all the interviews, focus was on UX related ', 'motivations and practices. However, activities such as product and business develop¬ ', 'ment were covered superficially to understand their impact on UX design. ', '', 'In the second phase, four semi-structured interviews were conducted to evaluate the ', 'MVUX framework established based on the results of the first phase. The concept of ', 'MVUX was first discussed with the interviewee after which we presented them the ', 'initial MVUX framework.

In addition, we studied the usefulness of the frame¬ ', 'work by discussing with the interviewees how startups could utilize the MVUX ', 'framework while creating early product versions. ', '', 'In both phases, analysis was done from the written transcripts utilizing iterative ', 'thematic coding.

', '', '6 Discussion ', '', 'Our contribution is in proposing a framework of UX elements that are essential to the ', 'early product versions startups create. Considering that the related research on startups ', 'in general and especially on their UX work is very limited, our study offers new insight ', 'both for the academia and for startups. In startups, the elements of MVUX could be ', 'used to guide the UX design of early product versions.

', '', 'The goals and key qualities for UX of the early product versions had recurring ', 'themes from which we abstracted the elements of MVUX.

', 'This provided a wide scale of goals and qualities that reflected the different situations ', 'the startups were in. The four main elements of MVUX that we found are Attrac¬ ', 'tiveness, Approachability, Professionalism, and Selling the Idea. ', '', 'Based on our evaluation of MVUX framework with startup representatives that had ', 'expertise in UX, the MVUX framework covers the most important elements of UX in ', 'the early stages of startup’s product development. However, the level of importance of ', 'different elements varies in products. Additionally, comparing the elements to our ', 'assumptions in the beginning of the study we can see how they are connected. We ', 'assumed that to communicate the product idea and UX well enough, the user should be ', 'able to perform the core use cases that answer to user’s needs. Furthermore, we ', 'estimated the UX in these use cases should be at a satisfying level that does not disturb ', 'the user. These are in line with the elements Approachability and Professionalism that ', 'aim to provide trouble-free UX that shows the user that the product is trustworthy. Our ', 'third assumption for MVUX was that it needs to enable startup to gain feedback and ', 'data for validation and further development. This would be achieved through elements ', 'of Selling the Idea and Attractiveness. The element Attractiveness has a role in getting ', 'users interested in the product as well as hooking them to keep using the product. ', 'Selling the Idea part needs to be in place to raise interest in users, to communicate the ', 'product idea clearly, and to show how the product creates value to user so they will ', 'keep using the product. Implementation of elements of Attractiveness and Selling the ', 'Idea enables continuous data collection from longer usage as well as users being able to ', 'give feedback on the product idea while having no confusion on what the product is ', 'about. However, our initial assumptions did not emphasize the attractiveness and good ', 'visual design of the product, while the results of this study show that they are con¬ ', 'sidered important in startups.

', 'Others show that switch costs are mostly determined by the task that is switched ', 'from [22]. This suggests that the residual impact is mostly determined by the ', 'previous task and that the results for the primary costs are ambiguous. Further, ', 'it matters what kind of stimuli and responses both tasks consist of. In the case ', 'where there is no overlap at all in stimuli and responses, task switching costs ', 'have found to be zero [25]. The more the stimuli and responses overlap, the ', 'greater the impact of the task switch. Furthermore, it has been found that when ', 'performing two task switches shortly after each other, switching back to the first ', 'task has higher switch costs than switching to a third, unrelated task [26].

This is ', 'of course to make them controllable and repeatable. With these simple tasks, ', 'switch costs are measured in order of milliseconds. The kind of real life switches ', 'that knowledge workers perform are several orders of magnitude more complex, ', 'how does the psychology research map to this?

We found that in all studies using a combination ', 'of simple and complexer tasks, the latter had higher associated switch costs; ', 'this was found already as early as 1927 [27].

Some practitioner sources claim effects in ', 'the order of minutes which is an indication of such a function and the relation ', 'between task complexity and switch cost. ', '', 'Task-switching between similar tasks is known to increase stress [28]. Pos¬ ', 'sible causes might be increasing the number of deadlines because of working ', 'on more tasks and decreasing the time available to meet the deadlines because ', 'of decreased productivity. On the other hand, [29] found that people very com¬ ', 'monly self-interrupt, which might be a form of self-protection, decreasing fatigue ', 'and increasing performance [30].

Another study found knowledge workers spend very little time in one ', 'context and are interrupted before completion 57 % of the time after which they ', 'tasks are resumed on average after 25 min [33]. Interruptions are often harmful, ', 'to a large degree because it takes time to get back into a task or project [34]. ', 'Tasks, when interrupted, take longer and have increased error rates [35]. How¬ ', 'ever, interruptions do not necessarily imply a context switch. Interruptions that ', 'lead to a switch between working spheres (e.g., two unrelated projects) are in ', 'general far more disruptive than interruptions from within the same sphere [32] . ', 'Further, Mark et al. [32] show that while co-located individuals (e.g., in open ', 'offices) face more interruptions in general, distributed individuals feel more free ', 'to engage in interruptions on topics that are actually unrelated to their work [32] . ', '', '', '3 Research Objectives ', '', 'While existing literature recommends minimizing the amount of concurrent ', 'projects, this might not be feasible for small companies depending on a large ', 'number of clients.

', '', 'Considering these facts we can assume that distraction, uncertainty and con¬ ', 'text switching are likely to increase especially if priorities across different projects ', 'are not clear. Literature suggests that teams working on multiple projects should ', 'work from one backlog during the sprint [16-19]. However, such task prioritiza¬ ', 'tion practices have been reported to be difficult to establish [13-15]. ', '', 'As such we pose the following research question: What barriers can be met ', 'and what benefits can arise from introducing a task prioritization practice to ', 'support a team working on multiple projects in parallel? ', '', '4 Research Method and Conduct ', '', 'In order to appropriately understand the dynamics of small organizations pur¬ ', 'suing multiple projects in context, a complex social phenomenon, we decided ', 'to conduct an exploratory action research in the context of a real organization. ', 'Action research (AR) is designed to create knowledge by organizational change ', 'through a collaboration between researchers and practitioners [36] . It does so by ', 'diagnosing the current state, bringing about guided changes and reflecting on ', 'the results to create theory. ', '', 'To ensure a credible research approach we applied the five principles of ', 'Canonical Action Research [37], as follows: 1. Researcher-client agreement: The ', 'research has been executed as part of a 2 year collaboration with the univer¬ ', 'sity. This ensured the collaboration of the company and provided the possibility ', 'to bring about change as part of daily routines as well as very frequent obser¬ ', 'vations. 2. Cyclical process model: We adopted the five-stage process model of ', 'Diagnosing, Action Planning, Action Taking, Evaluating and Specifying Learn¬ ', 'ing. One full cycle was completed. 3. Theory principle: The theoretical ambition ', 'is to understand task prioritization and coordination practices in agile teams, j. ', 'Change through action: We supported the case company throughout the entire ', 'project. The second author was a full-time employee at the company facilitat¬ ', 'ing workshops and discussions. 5. Learning through reflection: Throughout the ', 'project meetings and workshops have been initiated to stimulate discussions ', 'among developers and management by the second author. ', '', 'Case selection: The study was performed at a Dutch software company build¬ ', 'ing bespoke custom software for customers. The company consisted of about ', '20 employees, half of which were software developers. The company had two ', 'teams working for two or more Product Owners nearly all the time. A known ', '', '', '84 ', '', '', 'C.J. Stettina and M.N.W. Smit ', '', '', 'challenge at the beginning of the research. The company had a flat structure, ', 'informal work environment and an open office space. Next to building custom ', 'websites for customers there are two in-house products. The team works on one ', 'of those products but a majority of the time is spent customizing the product ', 'implementation per customer. Greenfield development is rare. Maintenance is ', 'often urgent, with deadlines of one or two days being common. Work load was ', 'always high because of too few developers. The company has been endorsing ', 'Scrum from the beginning, however, struggled with its’ implementation due to ', 'many parallel projects and customer requests. ', '', '', 'Data collection and data sources: In order to build up an adequate under¬ ', 'standing of the organization in context and throughout the action research ', 'project we used the following data sources: ', '', 'Observations: While embedded within the company, the second author was able ', 'to observe the relevant practices at the company, including: (1) daily stand-ups, ', '(2) portfolio meetings, (3) ‘ master stand-ups\\\\ (4) planning sessions, and (5) ', 'development activities. We conducted structured observations on 41 occasions. ', '', 'Semi-structured interviews: Next to informal discussions we conducted a total of ', '19 semi-structured interviews. Three types of interviews were executed: (1) Diag¬ ', 'nosing and scoping, (2) mid-term, and (3) post-action interviews. The interviews ', 'were conducted with the management and development teams. ', '', 'Questionnaires: We used bi-weekly questionnaires to create satisfaction graphs ', 'for involved practitioners over time (cf. [38]). The short questionnaires consisted ', 'of several questions using Likert-scales and open fields for additional remarks. ', 'Eight rounds of questionnaires have been collected with staff members. ', '', '', 'Data analysis: In contrary to traditional passive qualitative research, the ', 'action itself provides a primary origin of interpretation [36]. To support the ', 'reflection among researchers and involved actors all observation notes, inter¬ ', 'views and questionnaires were fully transcribed and used in discussions. ', '', '5 Action Research ', '', '5.1 Diagnosing ', '', 'Diagnosing started in May 2013 and lasted until December. To understand the con¬ ', 'text, interviews were held with employees across all roles, resulting in a descrip¬ ', 'tion of current roles and mapping of involved domains of practice. Generally the ', 'reported problems constituted a lack of structured process connecting the devel¬ ', 'opment to portfolio level decisions. On average the company has been working on ', 'two ‘very small’ projects and 30 to 40 ‘individual’ to ‘tiny’ sized projects a year. ', 'When the company grew it became very difficult to keep an overview and coor¬ ', 'dinate these projects effectively. Further, the small teams were linked to multiple ', 'POs exposing them to discussions due to conflicting customer priorities. ', '', '', 'An Action Research on Multitasking in Multi-project Scrum Teams ', '', '', '85 ', '', '', 'During interviews and discussions with developers and management we iden¬ ', 'tified a number of issues: (1) Development staff is highly distracted, to a large ', 'degree caused by discussions with multiple POs. (2) Little connection of portfo¬ ', 'lio to strategy. Little coordination across the portfolio leading to suboptimal and ', 'unprofitable choices. Portfolio decisions are made by developers. (3) Poor knowl¬ ', 'edge management, resulting in overhead and posing a danger to project continua¬ ', 'tion. (4) Daily maintenance shifts help get maintenance tasks done while keeping ', 'most of the resources focused, however, overhead for working on unknown projects ', 'is high. (5) Hard to keep an overview and deliver work promised to clients. ', '', '', '5.2 Action Planning ', '', 'Following the diagnosis, management acknowledged that improvements were nec¬ ', 'essary. In discussions with all actors it became clear that a team having to deal ', 'with multiple POs does not work well because developers end up making deci¬ ', 'sions about portfolio priorities for a large part of their time. It was concluded ', 'that removing the portfolio decisions from the development staff and limiting ', 'interruptions of staff by management will likely reduce the distraction of team ', 'members and improve portfolio decisions. In early June 2014 an initial plan ', 'was developed based around the following proposals: (1) Introduce agile portfo¬ ', 'lio management, (2) introduce stable teams, (3) work with true Scrum sprints, ', 'limit task switching, and (4) improve company-wide knowledge management. ', '', 'Based on that and hints found in practitioner’s literature (cf. [39]), we ', 'designed the Team Portfolio Scrum (TPS) practice and the Team Portfolio ', 'Owner (TPO) role to support the implementation of portfolio management. TPS ', 'is based on a one week Scrum cycle including the usual Scrum practices (e.g., ', 'Sprint and review, daily stand-ups, retrospectives) in which the PO is replaced ', 'by the TPO. The practice follows characteristics of agile portfolio management ', '[1] by (1) adding transparency of resources and work items through a Portfo¬ ', 'lio board, (2) close collaboration based on routines and artifacts enabling fre¬ ', 'quent feedback-loops across teams and management, (3) commitment to strate¬ ', 'gically managed portfolios, and (4) team orientation. In Table 2 we summarize ', 'the description and responsibilities of the new role. ', '', '5.3 Action Taking ', '', 'Before introducing the TPO role, a portfolio team, a portfolio board and a ', 'team portfolio backlog were introduced. The TPO role was appointed from one ', 'of the three POs previously working with the team. On June 25 a workshop ', 'was held with the development team and management staff. Initial resistance ', 'arose among the developers as the goal was initially defined around increasing ', 'engineer productivity. In response the goal was rephrased to remove mid-sprint ', 'management interruptions and portfolio level responsibilities from the engineers. ', '', 'Action taking began on June 30, 2015 with a reiteration of goals during a ', 'lunch presentation.

', '', '', '', 'An Action Research on Multitasking in Multi-project Scrum Teams ', '', '', '87 ', '', '', 'Barriers to a team portfolio task prioritization practice: Additional ', 'overhead: In the case company, the hours of a manager, including the TPO, ', 'can not be billed to clients: “As to whether it [the TPO role] is overhead, yes, ', 'per definition, because the work isn’t billable to the client. This is related to ', 'the way clients are billed at this company: actual booked development hours. ', 'Other methods exist that are much more suitable for Scrum [40] . However these ', 'methods assume one project per sprint. Billing might be a general problem for ', 'multi-project software development as is it hard to predict the proportions of ', 'the sprint for each customer in the face of scope changes. ', '', 'High workload: The TPO reported his high workload at several occasions, ', 'especially towards the end of the action: “..in the beginning I had much more ', 'time to do proper backlog management. “it is extremely busy to fulfill this role. ” ', '', 'Benefits to a team portfolio task prioritization practice: Better adher¬ ', 'ence to company strategy: Due to the oversight the TPO can make better deci¬ ', 'sions in coordination across the entire portfolio. Yet, choosing the right projects ', 'can be difficult for a small company: “For existing customers we basically have ', 'to do everything, we can’t choose to not do a project. It is useful to decide on ', 'new customers though.” ', '', 'Removing portfolio level decision making and conflicting decisions from mul¬ ', 'tiple POs: This benefit of the introduced role functioned very well from the ', 'beginning, as confirmed by observations and multiple actors. Before introducing ', 'the practice, developers had to make decisions and were blamed for those. When ', 'asked about what to do when a task threatens achieving the sprint goals, a ', 'developer commented: “I go directly to the TPO. The TPO manages what tasks ', 'get dropped. This works very well.” ', '', 'Limiting interrupting requests from multiple POs: Before the change POs ', 'would often come to a developer’s desk asking questions, planning work and ', 'lobbying for projects. As a developer comments: “It is easier for developers to ', 'defend themselves. ? and ?[the situation] improved. We have more breathing room ', 'because of the experiment. We can be more focused on software development. ” ', '', 'Specifying Learning. Not more than one large context switch per day: In our ', 'case organization the developers reported a benefit from the introduced TPS ', 'practice. However, also the number of parallel projects increased. Recommen¬ ', 'dations we found in literature deviate between two [12] parallel projects as an ', 'optimum, and not more than one large context switch per day - thus five projects ', 'per week. However, this largely depends on the homogeneity of the assignments. ', 'Here it is for the TPO and the team to discuss what a reasonable number of ', 'projects is according to: (1) familiarity with the project (architecture, code stan¬ ', 'dards), (2) homogeneity (domain, application type), and (3) urgency. ', '', 'TPO needs sufficient mandate: For fast resolving of issues, the TPO needs ', 'to have a complete mandate for choosing between the customers in the current ', 'sprint.

The POs had previously ', 'direct access to the teams, and had to go through the TPO as a Master Product ', 'Owner now. It took time to go through the TPO for planning or urgent mainte¬ ', 'nance: “For me as a PO, the effect was that the planning was less fine grained, ', 'which was something I had to get used to since Pm a control freak.

One of the many aspects of Scrum and similar approaches is that quality ', 'assurance is embedded in the process itself, and not explicitly documented. A Scrum ', 'team is supposed to be self-sustained, not having to rely on an external quality manage¬ ', 'ment or assurance function like a QA manager or QA department. The latter has been ', 'a typical role in line organizations doing plan-based development [19, 20]. First of all, ', 'a Scrum project enforces visibility and has frequent evaluation of status, progress and ', 'problems, which is used to re-plan and improve the project based on the most recent and ', 'updated knowledge. Scrum also has dedicated activities for managing quality issues ', 'with both the product under development and the process itself; each short work-period, ', 'or sprint, concludes with a sprint review and potentially also a retrospective.

Scrum also strongly emphasizes frequent inter¬ ', 'action with the customer or the problem owner, and XP stresses continuous and frequent ', 'testing. This is necessary to ensure that the functionality as well as the quality of the ', 'system meets requirements and expectations. In short- Scrum can be seen as a combined ', 'and self-sustained planning, development, and quality assurance process, although ', 'lacking traceability. ', '', 'Scrum was initially designed for small development projects with small self- ', 'managed teams, solving small-scale problems. Research from the past decade provides ', 'examples that this works well and that Scrum projects are more effective and flexible ', 'than plan-driven projects [4]. However, the trend in the software industry today is that ', 'Scrum is being used in increasingly more complex settings. We see cases where globally ', 'distributed Scrum teams collaborate in developing large software systems [6]. We also ', 'see that Scrum is being used for development of safety-critical systems, which have to ', 'comply with strict quality and safety standards [5, 14, 18]. ', '', 'This trend of increasing complexity means that the core principles of self-sustained, ', 'multi-disciplinary, and self-managed teams are challenged. In this paper, we look into ', 'how this development affects the embedded quality assurance function in Scrum. We ', 'base our analysis and discussion on an ongoing industry case where a Scrum team ', 'develops a high-integrity fire and gas detection system where the goal is to achieve a ', 'SIL3 (SIL: Safety Integrity Level) rating according to the IEC61508 standard [7]. The ', 'Scrum process used by the team is adjusted and continuously refined to match the ', 'requirements of the IEC61508 standard; we name this variant SafeScrum [18] (see ', 'Sect. 4 for more details). ', '', 'In the following, we present some background on the inherent challenges when ', 'developing and certifying safety-critical systems, on how SafeScrum can be adapted to ', 'support this process and the role of quality management and assurance. We then look ', 'into our case to show how this is being done in practical terms before we use our insights ', 'from the case to discuss how Scrum can be enforced to manage quality in high ', 'complexity settings. ', '', '2 Quality Assurance in Agile Software Development ', '', 'Mnkandla and Duolatzky gives a thorough discussion of the use of the term quality [11]. ', 'Most of the definitions identified by the two authors have a production focus and are not ', 'relevant for development. The concept of quality- software or otherwise - is defined by ', 'ISO 9000 as “the totality of characteristics of an entity that bear on its ability to satisfy ', 'stated and implied needs”. According to this definition, the main concept of quality is ', 'to make the customer happy. Deliver a quality product thus means to deliver a product ', 'that is according to the customer’s specified and implied requirements. Sticking with ', 'older definitions - e.g., quality is conformance to specifications - ignore the customer ', 'and is not a smart move in a competitive industry. ', '', 'Inherent in the plan-driven approach to software development is the idea that all ', 'requirements are known at the start of the project. With faster innovation, more rapid ', 'requirement changes, and more volatility allowed in the prioritized tasks, this idea is ', '', '', '94 ', '', '', 'G.K. Hanssen et al. ', '', '', 'void. Plan-driven development creates a significant risk that the users’ requirements ', 'remain unclear or that important opportunities for innovation are missed. The problem ', 'is that up-front requirements become increasingly irrelevant as the pace of innovation ', 'quickens and customers’ expectancy to fit-for-use rises. Consequently, the discrepancy ', 'between software practice, end-users and traditional requirements specification widens. ', 'Requirements that are out of sync with real needs has been claimed as a common cause ', 'of terminated IT projects [13]. ', '', 'Agile development attempts to allow for frequent updates of the requirements as the ', 'customer’s needs and problem understanding develop over time, thus increasing the ', 'probability of delivering improved product quality. ', '', '3 Safety Critical Software Development ', '', 'A system is defined as safety-critical if a failure may result in death or severe injury to ', 'people, loss or severe damage to property, or harm to the environment. Examples of ', 'such systems are fire alarm systems (failing to sound an alarm may cause casualties) or ', 'railway signaling systems (signal error may lead to collisions etc.). Safety critical ', 'systems are found in almost all parts of our daily lives, from transportation, to energy ', 'systems, in medical devices etc. Traditionally, such systems have been hardware reliant, ', 'but as hardware has become more powerful, flexible and programmable, the trend is that ', 'larger parts of the total system are implemented in software, meaning that the software ', 'complexity is growing. For example, the top-notch fighter plane of the forties, the Spit¬ ', 'fire, had zero lines of code. Today, the F-35 fighter has about 8 million lines of code ', 'where most of them comprise what could be defined a safety critical system [10]. ', '', 'Safety critical systems may be classified with a SIF value, defining the level of ', 'performance of the safety function of the system, or in other words, how likely the system ', 'is to operate as intended. The classification of levels varies between different standards, ', 'but for IEC61508, which is relevant to our case, SIF is divided from 1 to 4 where SIF ', '', '4 is the highest safety integrity level. ', '', 'In order to use a safety critical system, the customer needs a certificate. A “software ', 'certification demonstrates the reliability and safety of software systems in such a way ', 'that it can be checked by an independent authority with minimal trust in the techniques ', 'and tools used in the certification process itself’ [3]. The certificate is an independent ', 'document that ensures that the system operates as specified and according to the safety ', 'standard. This introduces the role of the assessor, an independent third party with the ', 'responsibility of assessing and eventually certifying that the development process ', 'leading to the system is compliant with the requirements in the standard. It is important ', 'to understand that a standard like IEC 61508 mainly has requirements for the process. ', 'As stated in the introduction: “This International Standard sets out a generic approach ', 'for all safety lifecycle activities for systems comprised of electrical and/or electronic ', 'and/or programmable electronic (E/E/PE) elements that are used to perform safety func¬ ', 'tions.” E.g., the section on architecture contains material on how to select architecture ', 'but no material on what the architecture should look like. ', '', '', 'Quality Assurance in Scrum Applied to Safety Critical Software ', '', '', '95 ', '', '', 'In practical terms, the standard is a list of good software engineering practices [15]. ', 'These must be followed or argued irrelevant. The designated SIL determines which ', 'requirements that are recommended or highly recommended. The assessor bases the ', 'assessment on proof of compliance, which are various types of information showing ', 'how requirements have been met. Providing such documentation imposes a large extra ', 'effort on the development project and in some cases it may actually constitute up to 50% ', 'of the total development cost [14]. ', '', 'Looking back at the past decades, we see that the development process of safety ', 'critical systems is optimized for hardware development, where design decisions have ', 'to be made early and locked prior to implementation to avoid late change in design, ', 'which may impose very high costs. Normally some variant of the V-model is used to ', 'guide design, implementation, testing and validation. ', '', 'As shown in Fig. 1, integration and validation testing is done on the right side of the ', 'V-meaning that a large part of the code-related documentation is made after coding. ', 'While a natural approach for most hardware development, this may impose problems ', 'for an agile software development project. Here, new or changed requirements will often ', 'lead to changes in the low-level design, which may then lead to changes in the code. In ', 'these cases, it is important to have well-documented code plus traceability from require¬ ', 'ments, via architecture and design down to code. ', '', '', '', 'Fig. 1 . The V-model ', '', '', 'During software development is it important to control size and complexity. ', 'Complexity is obvious - high complexity hinders understanding and can thus lead to ', 'errors. However, experience shows that sheer size also will create problems for devel¬ ', 'opers since a large code volume makes it difficult to keep the overview, which again ', 'leads to coding errors. ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '96 ', '', '', 'G.K. Hanssen et al. ', '', '', '4 SafeScrum - Agile Development of Safety Critical Software ', '', 'SafeScrum is a variant of the well-known and extensively used Scrum development ', 'model [16] where some additional elements are added to be able to fulfill the process ', 'requirements from the IEC61508 standard [18]. Based on a thorough investigation of ', 'the requirements in the standards part 3 which defines the software part of the total ', 'system [14], we propose a set of extensions to make Scrum applicable to development ', 'of safety critical software. Firstly, there are two backlogs, one for functional require¬ ', 'ments and one for safety requirements. Functional requirements may change frequently ', 'whilst safety requirements normally are stable and even reusable between projects and ', 'products. Relationships between these are maintained to keep track of which safety ', 'requirements that are affected by which functional requirements. Secondly, SafeScrum ', 'needs to be a traceable process. All decisions and changes throughout development must ', 'be documented, stored and made available to the assessor. The same goes for code ', 'reviews where all remarks and how they were resolved needs to be kept track of. Thirdly, ', 'each sprint encompasses a validation of the safety of the present system. As part of the ', 'sprint review of each sprint, the product backlog may be updated. In cases where a ', 'change is considered to affect the safety of the system, a change impact analysis (CIA) ', '[17] is done - and documented. Here the two backlogs come in handy as a mean to ', 'identify how a change related to a functional requirement potentially influences a safety ', 'requirement. Besides these extensions, common features of agile practices are important, ', 'like test-driven development (important to establish high test coverage), regular work ', 'iterations, daily stand-ups, and continuous integration. ', '', 'A series of sprints replace the ‘coding’ part and the ‘evaluation’ part of the V-model. ', 'This means that documentation is produced continuously and as a part of development ', 'and not as a finalizing phase as described by the V-model. SafeScrum simply replaces ', 'the bottom and right side of the V-model. This is fundamentally important for software ', 'development and enables a project to become more flexible with respect to changes and ', 'still be able to provide the needed documentation and traceability to the assessor. ', '', 'Adding these new elements to Scrum is necessary to meet the requirements of the ', 'IEC61508 standard. However, this also compromises the concept of a lightweight ', 'process as a lot of extra work, checkpoints and especially documentation are added. The ', 'most important countermeasure is clever and efficient use of tools to automate as much ', 'of the extras as possible. We have identified four classes of tools. Firstly, we need a tool ', 'to support process and workflow management, like defining, assigning and following ', 'up tasks, their responsibilities and order, etc. Put simply, this is a tool to automate the ', 'Scrum board. Secondly, we need tools to establish and maintain traceability of require¬ ', 'ments, tests and code. Even a small project will generate large amounts of information, ', 'which requires tool support. Thirdly, we need dedicated tools for managing information ', 'like design, code and architectural documentation. Fourthly, we need tools to support ', 'code quality assurance, which is particularly important with respect to IEC61508. This ', 'includes test coverage analysis, static code analysis and test automation. There are plenty ', 'of tools to choose from and many of them are flexible and can be combined and linked ', 'to create a tool chain to support the SafeScrum process. The IEC61508 standard has ', '', '', 'Quality Assurance in Scrum Applied to Safety Critical Software ', '', '', '97 ', '', '', 'requirements to tools and should be checked (IEC61508-3, Sect. 7.4.4, and table A3). ', 'The walkthrough of our case will provide concrete examples of such a tool chain (Fig. 3). ', '', '', '', 'Fig. 2. The SafeS crum model ', '', '', '5 A SafeScrum Case ', '', 'The authors have been working with Autronica Fire & Security for about two years in ', 'order to detail and trial the SafeScrum process in a real SIF3 industrial case. This ', 'collaboration is part of a large R&D project, partly funded by the Research Council of ', 'Norway. The collaboration is organized as an action research project [2] and the case ', 'being described here shows some of the findings, so far. All data are collected, managed ', 'and reported according to a joint R&D contract. ', '', 'Autronica Fire & Security [1], with 380 employees, is an internationally leading ', 'provider of fire and gas detection systems. A large part of the business is offshore instal¬ ', 'lations at oilrigs and ships where demands for safety performance are high. Our case is ', 'a project developing new software for a fire detection system, SIF 3. ', '', 'The authors have followed the case project from the start and collected data in the ', 'form of 1) observations of sprint review and planning meetings (11), 2) analysis of ', 'documentation like project plans and requirements documents, and 3) interviews and ', 'discussions with the Scrum team and related roles. This also includes the assessor (a ', 'TUV organization), which has been asked to comment on our development process ', '(SafeScrum). This dialogue has been important to ensure that the development process ', 'and the documentation it produces meet the expectations and is aligned with the ', 'IEC61508 standard. The product being developed by the case project itself is however ', 'not yet certified - the completion is still some years ahead. In addition to this participative ', 'role in the shaping of SafeScrum, the researchers also made an analysis of the standard ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '98 ', '', '', 'G.K. Hanssen et al. ', '', '', 'to identify any issues with respect to using an agile method [18]. Such issues were ', 'discussed with the Scrum team to ensure compliance. The SafeScrum process has ', 'emerged through practice. It started out by using only a few fundamental principles, like ', 'short iterations and daily standups. Based on growing experience and dialogue between ', 'researchers, team members, the product owner and the external assessor, the SafeScrum ', 'process and related tools are continuously being refined and extended. ', '', 'The project started development in January 2014 with a Scrum team of five experi¬ ', 'enced and co-located developers, one of them also acting as Scrum Master. Previous ', 'experience and education in Scrum were low - only one of the developers had some ', 'experience with Scrum from his previous workplace. Other than that the team read a ', 'basic introduction [8], and in addition the researchers had a few seminars at the case ', 'company, addressing agile principles, research and examples. ', '', 'This was the first attempt at applying Scrum in the development department and ', 'started out with a simplistic process. Sprint duration was set to four weeks. The team ', 'shared workspace with separate offices and a common area in between and used a ', 'whiteboard with stickers to track work items and their flow from planned, in progress ', 'to done. The product owner role was managed by a company internal with extensive ', 'knowledge of the market, the requirements, and the technology. The team focused on ', 'producing working code and unit tests from early on and a put emphasis on improving ', 'the Scrum process continuously. Each sprint ended with a sprint retrospective where the ', 'process was evaluated by the team, adjustments were made and new tools were trialed ', 'and added/removed as needed. ', '', 'After a few sprints, Jira was introduced to manage the workflow and thus replaced ', 'the manual scrum board. RMsis, a plug-in for Jira, was used to establish traceability of ', 'the requirements management process. Confluence was used to support team collabo¬ ', 'ration and to document the sprints, e.g. by storing memos from sprint reviews. Stash ', 'and Git was used to manage software version control and code reviews and Bamboo ', 'was used for continuous builds, tests and release management. Doxygen was used for ', 'maintaining design and code documentation. In addition, a set of tools was used for ', 'additional quality assurance; Gtest and Gmoc were used to manage unit tests, Squish ', 'Coco was used for code coverage analysis and QAC/QACPP for static code analysis. ', '', 'In total, these tools constitute a tool-chain where some of the tools are linked and ', 'operate as a greater whole. In particular, Jira serves as a hub in the tool chain. There are ', 'many alternative tools and ways of composing them, but in our case, this setup enables ', 'the Scrum team to be both agile and to automate many of the additional requirements ', 'imposed by the IEC61508 standard. Figure 3 shows how the tools are inter-related.

The tool-chain supporting the SafeScrum process ', '', '', '6 The Need for Extra Attention to Quality Management ', '', 'The shaping and introduction of SafeScrum at the case company has been done step by ', 'step and by building on growing experience. The described process extensions and the ', 'tool chain made the team able to produce and maintain the information required to ', 'achieve a SIL3 certificate. However, after a few months, and sprints, of operation we ', 'saw that this also puts a burden on the team, and in particular on the Scrum master who ', 'spent an increasingly large amount of time making sure that development was compliant ', 'with IEC61508. Some corrective actions were made but there was a concern that some ', 'glitches happened. It was also not clear what the most important considerations to make ', 'were. In short, the project needed some clarification on quality assurance, and asked the ', 'researchers for assistance. ', '', 'This led us to consult the assessor to clarify his expectations for QA on three topics: ', '', '1. Question: Traceability of safety related requirements: Is it sufficient to have a trace ', 'between documents or should it be possible to trace issues down to sections, pages, ', 'or lines in the text? ', '', 'Answer: The assessor requires a link between requirements and tests, e.g. by refer¬ ', 'ring to unique requirements ID in test cases. ', '', 'Response: This level of trace is handled by a dedicated requirements management ', 'tool, RMsis, linking requirements to tests that validates them, as well as linking ', 'requirements and tests to design and code. However, we have identified a need to ', 'manually verify that this is done correctly and to make necessary corrections. The ', 'QA role shall continuously verify that traceability is kept up to date and verify that ', 'all steps of the process are done. ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '100 ', '', '', 'G.K. Hanssen et al. ', '', '', '2. Question: The standard directs ‘limited use of interrupts, pointers and recursion’ - ', 'are there exact limits or does it mean that we should avoid this as much as possible? ', 'Answer: You should make a table with use of interrupts, pointers etc. and a simple ', 'explanation for why this must be used. ', '', 'Response: Someone needs to check for “bad code” in every sprint and decide whether ', 'it should be corrected (refactored) or whether the table of reasoned exceptions should ', 'be updated. This can be assisted by checking for pointers during static code analysis. ', '', '3. Question: Control of size and complexity: should we aim for specific limits for ', 'module complexity? ', '', 'Answer: You need to define something that is useful to you, and argue why - the ', 'standard does not specify this. ', '', 'Response: We have defined a set of metrics and their values that are important for ', 'this specific project. Checking code is done by tools (QAC and QACPP) but there ', 'is a need to verify that this is done in every sprint and that any deviations are resolved, ', 'typically by refactoring or improving code in the following sprint. ', '', 'In addition to these issues raised from the dialogue with the assessor, we also saw that ', 'quality of documentation and test coverage had become unsatisfactory. All in all, it ', 'became obvious that the self-regulating quality mechanisms in Scrum were overloaded ', 'and that there was a need to strengthen the QA function. A dedicated QA function is a ', 'necessary part of SafeScrum, but it is important to remember that the entire team still ', 'has a large responsibility for QA as well. The team plays an important role e.g. in retro¬ ', 'spectives to continuously improve the development process and in resolving issues that ', 'are identified by the QA-role. ', '', '7 Shaping an Embedded QA Role in SafeScrum ', '', 'Using the insights described above, the researchers, the Scrum team and the product ', 'owner had a series of meetings to define a specific QA role in SafeScrum to alleviate ', 'the problems. The traditional approach in this and similar organizations would be to ', 'place the QA role as a specialized function in the line organization, outside the project. ', 'We decided, however, to add the QA role to the Scrum team to be close to the activities ', 'and to the information needed to execute quality assurance. This adds to the principle ', 'of cross functional teams [12] in Scrum. We are also considering making this a rotating ', 'role to make it a shared responsibility and to share the workload. We need a QA log to ', 'trace findings, decisions, corrective actions, and the follow up/results of these. In our ', 'case, Confluence is a good tool to establish this log. We have identified four tasks: ', '', 'QA Task 1: Check Code Metric Values for New or Changed Code: Neither the ', 'IEC61508 standard nor the assessor provide directions on specific metrics and limits to ', 'monitor at the component level. We have consulted the research literature [9] and used ', 'Minitab to analyze data from code from previous projects at the case company to define ', 'the following metrics and limits: (1) number of static paths - STPTH: 250, (2) McCabe’s ', 'cyclomatic number - STCYC: 15, (3) number of parameters - STPAR: 5, (4) function ', '', '', 'Quality Assurance in Scrum Applied to Safety Critical Software ', '', '', '101 ', '', '', 'call count - STSUB: 13, (5) maximum nesting of control structures - STMIF: 5, (6) ', 'number of executable lines - STXLN: 70, and (7) Myer’s value - (STMCC): 10. ', '', 'QAC is used to analyze new and changed code to produce values for the metrics. ', 'This is done at the end of each sprint. The metrics are displayed, together with their ', 'defined maximum values in a radar plot. It is thus easy to if there are metrics that are ', 'exceeding their defined limits. If the values are inside their limits, QA will accept the ', 'code. If one or more values are outside their limits, the code is presented by QA in the ', 'sprint review meeting where the team decides to either accept the violation or plan ', 'refactoring. If the violation is accepted, a brief explanation must be added to the log and ', 'potentially also in the code (required by the standard). If the violation is unacceptable, ', 'the team needs to define a new task in Jira to refactor the code. ', '', 'QA Task 2: Check Documentation Coverage: Check new/changed code to ensure ', 'proper inline documentation and documents in Doxygen. This has to be done manually. ', 'In case of missing or poor documentation, the QA-log should be updated and the findings ', 'should be discussed in the sprint review meeting to decide how to resolve it (giving a ', 'task to someone in the team). This check could be done at the end of each sprint. ', '', 'QA Task 3: Check Test Coverage: Check for code coverage using Squish Coco. The ', 'QA log should be updated with references to uncovered code. This could be checked by ', 'the end of each sprint. Uncovered code should be discussed at the sprint review meeting ', 'and the team should define corrective actions, like defining tasks to produce tests. ', 'According to the standard, the coverage should be at least 99%. ', '', 'QA Task 4: Check Requirements-Task-Code Traceability: For new requirements, ', 'tasks, and code check that 1) requirements (RMsis) is linked to issues (e.g. in Jira), and ', '2) that code (e.g. Stash) is linked to issues (e.g. Jira). The QA role should control ', 'consistency at the end of the sprint and the team should resolve any identified issues ', 'immediately. The IEC61508 standard provides a set of explicit requirements for trace- ', 'ability; see table A.4 - Software design and development - detailed design, and table ', 'A.5 - Software design and development - software module testing and integration. We ', 'consulted the assessor about a definition of ‘module’ and its size (LOC). He referred to ', 'part 7, chapter C.2.9: “a software module should have a single well-defined task or ', 'function to fulfill.” The assessor recommended 1000 LOC as an upper limit. In cases ', 'where the limit is exceeded it should be explained and documented. ', '', 'The tasks have been defined to be as simple and inexpensive as possible, partly by using ', 'the tool chain that already is in place. The goal is to not add more work to the process ', 'ceremony than strictly needed, but to use the QA role to simplify the sprint reviews so ', 'that they are not bogged down with unimportant details. So far, this is done by letting ', 'the QA close issues that have low risk and complexity on his own in advance of the ', 'sprint retrospective, where the whole team participates. This reduces the time spent on ', 'unimportant decisions and helps the team focus on difficult tasks where a joint evaluation ', 'and decision is needed. ', '', '', '', '102 ', '', '', 'G.K.

', '', '8 Conclusions ', '', 'After around two years of shaping and using SafeScram we see that the inherent quality ', 'assurance mechanisms in Scrum are not sufficient to meet the demands imposed by the ', 'IEC61508 standard. We have consulted the assessor to ensure a proper match with the ', 'standard and shaped a new role to Scrum. ', '', 'Developing safety critical solutions using SafeScrum, calls for a lot of extra attention, ', 'ceremony and documentation, which initially may be seen as a threat to the ability to be ', 'agile [13]. However, we see that the iterative nature of Scrum with frequent breaks ', 'between the sprints in addition to the tool chain we have put into use makes it possible ', 'to manage quality assurance internally in the team without adding too much extra work. ', '', 'As part of further work we will look into opportunities to streamline and perfect this ', 'new role as it is vital to maintain an efficient SafeScrum process and to meet the require¬ ', 'ments of the IEC61508 standard and the assessors expectations.

Consequently, IDEs play a ', 'major role in making developers productive and feel comfortable during their daily ', 'activities. Yet despite their important role, little is known about how these tools support ', 'developers and the nature of UX with such tools. While it may be overreaching to ', 'conclude that happy developers are better at their work [2], both happiness and ', 'motivation have been connected with raised productivity [3]. Mood influences devel¬ ', 'opers’ performance on programming tasks [4], and happiness has been found to have ', 'productivity benefits [5]. ', '', 'Although qualities of both developers and development work have been studied, ', 'developers have rarely been investigated as users of development tools. As developers are ', 'users of IDEs, all that is true of any user according to UX definitions (e.g. [6]), should ', 'apply also to developers. However, the dual role of developer as both users of systems and ', 'developers of systems makes them special: besides being IDE users, developers should be ', 'able to understand the human user to be able to fulfill their needs with the software under ', 'development. A concept of developer experience (DX) has been suggested to address the ', 'particularities to SE [7]. The concept of DX is influenced by the concept of UX [7]. ', 'Moreover, DX consists of aspects related to cognition, affect, and intention and an ', 'understanding of the concept should help practitioners in improving development ', 'environments with respect to developers’ needs, perceptions and feelings [7]. ', '', 'In this paper we address DX in terms of the experienced state of flow, intrinsic ', 'motivation (IM) and UX. Our goal is to determine the core concepts and predictors of ', 'DX related to IDE usage in order enable improvement of IDEs to improve developers’ ', 'IM towards their work and their ability to experience flow (deep, focused, rewarding ', 'concentration) during their work. Our assumption is that these factors both make ', 'developers’ work more enjoyable and increase their productivity. To this end, we ', 'conducted a survey of developers’ experiences of software development using a par¬ ', 'ticular IDE, Qt Creator. We used the Short Dispositional Flow Scale (SDFS-2) [8], ', 'parts of Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) [9], and a UX scale consisting of the Short ', 'AttrakDiff-2 [10] and our own DEXI scale. We ran multiple linear regression analyses ', 'to investigate whether these scales can significantly predict developers’ ratings of ', 'overall UX (OUX) and the IDE’s ability to fulfill their needs (need fulfillment score, ', 'NFS). Moreover, we address the impact of perceived choice of Qt Creator since it often ', 'is the employer who decides which tools are used. Finally, we present best qualities and ', 'areas for improvement in the IDE as assessed by the respondents. Our contributions ', 'include increased understanding of developers as users, and core UX concepts related ', 'to DX and developers’ needs related to IDEs.

Then the results ', 'section presents the linear regression analyses on the scales’ ability to predict OUX and ', 'NFS, the impact of perceived choice on DX, and the core qualities of IDEs. We discuss ', 'our results and threats to validity. Finally, we present concluding remarks. ', '', '', '106 ', '', '', 'K. Kuusinen et al. ', '', '', '2 Background ', '', '', 'Motivation and Flow. One of the current influential theories of motivation is ', 'self-determination theory developed by Deci and Ryan [11]. They distinguish between ', 'intrinsic (IM) and extrinsic motivations (EM). IM refers to engaging in a task because ', 'of it is inherently pleasurable and satisfying, whereas EM refers to engaging in a task ', 'because of its outcomes, the task is used as a means to lead to the outcome [11]. In ', 'contrast, flow refers to a state of concentration so focused that it amounts to absolute ', 'absorption in an activity [12]. Applicable to both work and leisure [13], flow builds on ', 'IM and internal reward over the achievement rather than on external goal or recog¬ ', 'nition. Its effect can be characterized as being totally focused on a particular task at ', 'hand, so that the person becomes fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full ', 'involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. While immersed, three ', 'conditions have to be met to achieve a flow state [14]: (1) One must be involved in an ', 'activity with a clear set of goals and progress ; (2) The task at hand must have clear and ', 'immediate feedback ; (3) One must have a good balance between the perceived chal¬ ', 'lenges of the task at hand and their own perceived skills, so that there can be confidence ', 'in one’s ability to complete the task at hand. ', '', 'User Experience. Commonly, UX is understood as subjective, context-dependent, ', 'and dynamic [15]. It is affected by user’s expectations, needs and motivation, as well as ', 'system characteristics such as purpose and functionality, and the context of use ', 'including physical, organizational and psychological aspects [6]. The ', 'hedonic-pragmatic model of UX divides user experience into a hedonic or ', 'non-utilitarian dimension and a pragmatic or instrumental dimension [16]. Hassenzahl ', '[16] further divides the hedonic into two sub-dimensions of identification and stimu¬ ', 'lation while the pragmatic/instrumental dimension relates to usability and usefulness. ', '', 'Software Engineering. The core of software development is writing program code ', 'that constructs the running software; this demands the ability to concentrate and work ', 'alone for many hours [17]. Moreover, programming work requires a logical mind and ', 'the ability to pay attention to details [17]. Developers need to be analytical, capable of ', 'making decisions, independent, creative, tenacious, and be able to tolerate stress [18]. ', 'Although programmers tend to be introverted, sensing, and thinking [17], social skills ', 'are crucial in their work: developers’ interpersonal and communication skills have been ', 'considered even more important than their technical skills for project success [19]. Due ', 'to the complex nature of software development, specialized tools are used. One of the ', 'most general tools that are used to create programs is an IDE, which offers numerous ', 'features. A sophisticated IDE, extended with plugins, may manage dependencies ', 'among different packages and modules, control complex builds, and provide linking to ', 'other tools such as requirements management or test environment. Thus, the IDE acts ', 'as an interface between the developer and the computing infrastructure that is needed ', 'for creating, configuring, and managing complex applications as well as their source ', 'code and build environment. ', '', '', 'Flow, Intrinsic Motivation, and Developer Experience 107 ', '', '', 'IDEs have two main productive goals: increasing developer speed and reducing the ', 'number of errors made by developers [1]. As IDEs are a main tool in software ', 'development, they also play a major role in making developers productive and com¬ ', 'fortable in their work. Moreover, IDEs are a key aspect in developer experience (DX), ', 'a concept that encompasses developer’s perceptions of their work and phenomena ', 'related to it such as cognitive, motivational, affective, and social aspects. For example, ', 'memory overload is a limiting factor for programmers, especially for beginners who ', 'have not yet developed strategies to relieve it [20]. Modem development environments ', 'provide many aids to programmers, but the same challenges are still present. Cognitive ', 'factors also concern larger structures in software development, such as methods and ', 'processes, but research on this aspect is scarce. ', '', 'Developer Experience and Motivation. The concept of DX aims to provide an ', 'intuitive abstraction of the huge variety and quantity of human factors that influence ', 'developers and the outcomes of SE [7]. While UX considers the context of use of a ', 'system, DX considers the context of software development, including aspects beyond ', 'software tools, such as development processes, modeling methods, and other means of ', 'stmcturing SE tasks. Some of these aspects are embedded in tools such as IDEs while ', 'others are part of organizational practices. The software development activity and ', 'environment differ in significant ways from other information-intensive activities and ', 'environments. For example, software development requires a nested understanding: ', 'developers use software to build further software that is to be used by users to ', 'accomplish their particular tasks. Also, developers frequently configure and extend ', 'their tools, in effect continuously developing both the development environment and ', 'the end product at the same time. ', '', 'Developer motivation is as another important factor in SE. The majority of studies ', 'on motivation in SE report that developers are distinct from other occupational groups ', 'with respect to motivation [3]. “The work itself’ is the most commonly cited motivator, ', 'but there is a lack of detail regarding what aspects of the work is motivating, how ', 'motivational processes occur, and the outcomes of motivating developers [3, 21]. ', 'Investigations also show the importance of considering affective aspects of SE. The ', 'presence and variation of developers’ emotions over time has been documented [22]. ', 'Programming is influenced by mood [4], and happiness has been found to have pro¬ ', 'ductivity benefits [2]. This underlines the importance of considering affective aspects ', 'both for purposes of well-being and outcomes. ', '', '', '3 Method ', '', 'Our research goal is to increase understanding of DX. We aim to clarify how flow, IM, ', 'and UX are intertwined in software development. This will enable improvement of ', 'development tools to better support developers’ ability to experience flow in their work ', 'and to enhance developers’ IM towards their work. Our hypothesis is that these factors ', 'make developers’ work more enjoyable and increases their productivity. ', '', '', '108 ', '', '', 'K. Kuusinen et al.

How do developers describe the best qualities of the IDE and those that need ', 'improvement in relation to UX vocabulary? ', '', 'We found that developers considered efficiency, flexibility, informativeness and ', 'intuitiveness the best qualities of the IDE whereas flexibility, informativeness, and ', 'reliability required improvement the most. Developers described qualities of the ', 'IDE with regard to the following practical qualities: productivity and interaction and ', 'information quality. System quality represented general quality in developers’ ', 'descriptions and hedonic qualities were related to stimulation, appeal, and aesthetic ', 'quality. ', '', 'Reflections on Concept of Developer Experience. Fagerholm et al.’s [7] framework ', 'of DX addresses the concept in terms of factors related to the perception of develop¬ ', 'ment infrastructure, feelings towards work, and the value of the developer’s contri¬ ', 'bution. They relate cognition to the perception of infrastructure, affect with feelings ', 'towards the work, and intention (conation) with the value of contribution. In our study, ', 'the IDE itself represents the development infrastructure and cognition, affect and ', 'intention were addressed with regard to it. Our results indicate that developers also ', 'address the infrastructure via intention and affect. Their IM was towards both the use of ', 'the IDE and the development work. Some developers described the best qualities of the ', 'IDE with affection. In addition, the overall UX assessment of developers seemed to be ', 'affected more by the hedonic than pragmatic quality of the IDE since the mean value of ', 'the hedonic aspect of UX (HQ) was on the borderline of being a significant predictor of ', 'overall UX (p = 0.05) whereas the overall UX could not be predicted from the practical ', 'or general quality. Thus, our results suggest that Fagerholm et al. over emphasized the ', 'cognitive approach of developers towards the development infrastructure. Moreover, ', 'the developers’ intrinsic motivation also seems to focus on using the IDE while ', 'Fagerholm et al. associate it with the developer’s contribution. However, the IDE is ', 'used to create a contribution and thus our study cannot separate motivation towards ', 'development work itself and motivation towards the software under development. ', '', 'Threats to Validity. We studied only one IDE and thus some of our results might be ', 'specific to that. We also had a relatively limited number of respondents (57). In the ', 'future, other IDEs and development work in general should be studied. We did not ', 'control multiple answering of the questionnaire but asked developers to respond only ', 'once. However, we consider the likelihood of multiple answering small. Since the ', 'invitation to participate was sent to an online developer community and Twitter, only ', 'developers who use those channels could participate, thus limiting the population of ', 'developers we sampled from. However, we found no significant difference between ', '', '', 'Flow, Intrinsic Motivation, and Developer Experience 115 ', '', '', 'developers who were recruited via the online community and those contacted via ', 'Twitter. In addition, demographic variables were not significant predictors of any of the ', 'studied variables. ', '', '6 Conclusions ', '', 'We have presented results of software developers’ sense of flow, their intrinsic moti¬ ', 'vation (IM) and developer experience (DX) in the context of software engineering. We ', 'conducted a survey study on developers using Qt Creator as their development envi¬ ', 'ronment. We aimed to clarify how flow, IM, and UX are intertwined in software ', 'development. Our final goal is the improvement of development tools to better support ', 'developers’ ability to experience flow - deep, focused, rewarding concentration in their ', 'work - and to enhance developers’ IM towards their work. Our hypothesis was that ', 'these factors make developers’ work more enjoyable and increase their productivity. ', 'Our results suggest that IM and sense of flow are significant predictors of DX.

', 'Moreover, we found perceived choice of use a significant predictor of both developers’ ', 'assessment of UX and need fulfillment.

Different from established companies, startups typi¬ ', 'cally deal with identifying and implementing a product that delivers actual customer ', 'value [1]. Recent methodological approaches for startup product development, i.e. ', 'Lean startup [3] or new product development processes [2] emphasize the ability to ', 'learn about actual problems from early customers and the speed of learning. According ', 'to Lean Startup [3], every startup should start with building a Minimum viable product ', '(MVP), and use it to validate their hypotheses about customer needs. ', '', 'MVPs, defined as products with just enough features to gather validated learning ', 'about the products, is a major focus in early stages. It plays an important role not only ', 'for a startup team, but also the startup’s external stakeholders, such as potential users, ', 'investors and mentors. Nowadays, MVP is a key artifact to be shown in a meeting with ', 'an investor. There are several different types of MVPs, varied by development efforts, ', 'their purposes and stages they often occur [3].

A single ', 'feature prototype, as another MVP, might take several months for construction and ', 'integrate into final product. Besides, different MVPs might be used to serve the same ', 'purpose, for instance, to communicate with investors. ', '', 'It is little known about how MVPs are used after their creation, from both com¬ ', 'munity of practitioners and researchers. Given the importance of MVPs for early stage ', 'startups, we are interested in understanding how the MVP is used in software startups: ', '', '“RQ: How are MVPs used in early stage software startups?” ', '', 'We argued that from an engineering perspective a MVP shares a lot of charac¬ ', 'teristics with a software prototype. Prototyping has a long history in Software Engi¬ ', 'neering (SE) research, as an essential part of water fall life cycle [5]. However, in SE ', 'research, there is little discussion about prototypes in the context of software startups ', '[6, 7]. In this paper, we discussed about the usage of MVP in the relation to prototype’s ', 'characteristics. We also argued that MVPs has been used to communicate with external ', 'stakeholders, such as investors and early customers. Information System (IS) has a ', 'theory to explain about how an artifact was used to communicate among different ', 'communities with different expertise [8]. Therefore, we utilized the boundary spanning ', 'theory to initiate and to capture the MVP usage. ', '', 'The paper is organized as follows; firstly we presented backgrounds about MVPs, ', 'software prototype and boundary spanning theory (Sect. 2). Then, we described our ', 'research approach and case description (Sect. 3). After that, the qualitative findings are ', 'presented (Sect. 4). Finally, we discussed the reflections of study, threats to validity ', '(Sect. 5), conclusion and future work (Sect. 6). ', '', '2 Background ', '', '2.1 Classification of MVPs and Prototypes ', '', 'Eric Ries initiates the classification of MVP types [3], which are discussed among the ', 'community of practitioners, including: ', '', '• Explainer video: a short animation that explains what your product does and why ', 'users should buy it. The video is often simple, lasts for 30 s to few minutes. ', '', '• Landing page: a web page where visitors “land” after clicking a link from an e-mail ', 'or another type of a campaign. A landing page is used to quickly communicate the ', 'startup proposals, to diffuse objections, and to call the visitors to action. ', '', '• Wizard of Oz: an user interface that looks like a real working product, but the actual ', 'business process is manually carried on. The purpose of this MVP is to demonstrate ', 'the complete job done by the product. ', '', '• Concierge MVP: a manual service that consists of exactly the same steps users ', 'would go through with the product. ', '', '• Piecemeal MVP: similar to Wizards of Oz MVP, however, execution of the tasks is ', 'done by using existing tools. ', '', '• Mockup MVP: such as, paper prototype and wireframe, was representative of ', 'product user interface without any functionality. ', '', '', '120 ', '', '', 'A.N. Due and P. Abrahamsson ', '', '', '• Public project proposal: Kickstarter and other crowdsourcing sites allow for users to ', 'pre-purchase the product and provide a great way to raise money for initial orders. ', '', '• Single feature MVP: a prototype that implements the most important function of the ', 'product. ', '', '• Rip olf MVP: a successful product to get feedback, then pivot in a different ', 'direction. ', '', 'The term “prototype” is also often used in startup context as an interchangeable ', 'term with MVP. There are different types of software prototypes often used in early ', 'phases of software development, such as throwaway, or rapid prototype, which con¬ ', 'sumes very little efforts with minimum requirement analysis to build a prototype [9]. ', 'Another type of prototype is evolutionary prototype, which bases on building actual ', 'minimal functionality in the beginning [9]. Last but not least, incremental prototype ', 'refers to building multiple functional prototypes of the various sub systems and then ', 'integrating all the available prototypes to form a complete system [9]. In this paper, we ', 'use the above categories to differentiate and discuss about different type of MVPs ', 'during earl-stage software startups. ', '', '', '2.2 Theory of Boundary Spanning ', '', 'To explain the roles of MVPs and prototypes, we borrow the theory of boundary ', 'spanning across boundaries in software startups. From the view of knowledge man¬ ', 'agement, most innovation happens at the boundaries between specialized pools of ', 'knowledge [8, 10, 11]. Three types of knowledge boundary is commonly mentioned in ', 'IS literature: ', '', '• A syntactic knowledge boundary occurs when there is a lack of a shared syntax and ', 'creates the concern that information may not be processed properly across a given ', 'boundary [8]. For instance, entrepreneurs use business terms that make developers ', 'do not understand. ', '', '• A semantic knowledge boundary occurs when a common syntax is present, different ', 'interpretations of the common syntax make communication and collaboration dif¬ ', 'ficult [8]. For instance, a designer might think about artistic mindset while a ', 'developer think of software architecture when talking about design thinking. ', '', '• Pragmatic knowledge boundary occurs when a common interest has to be achieved ', 'when participants negotiate with each other on the scope [8], consequences and ', 'conflict solutions of knowledge delivery, i.e. developers and entrepreneur do not ', 'share common interests, i.e. a clash of interests occurs. ', '', 'Boundary artifact is used to cross these different types of knowledge boundaries ', '[10]. The theory states that an artifact only helps bridging knowledge boundaries if it ', 'qualifies as a boundary object, which is described as an artifact that “sits in the middle ” ', 'of diverse knowledge groups, establishing a “shared and sharable ” context for dis¬ ', 'tributed problem solving. These artifacts need to be “both plastic enough to adapt to ', 'local needs and constraints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to ', 'maintain a common identity across sites ” [11].

', '', 'Initial ideas and prototypes can vary, hence, cross-check during prototyping phase ', 'is often necessary. For non-technical founders, visualizing their thoughts is important ', 'to provide inputs for technical design: “I have many great ideas, but I have no idea if ', 'they can be implemented. Building a prototype at least allows me and also others in my ', 'team to ask the right questions... Visions and theory are notoriously hard to implement. ', 'A prototype has to be real enough to be convincing, without looking like science ', 'fiction .” (CEO of Company C). ', '', 'Reflection on Architectural Design: MVP prototyping process is where product design ', 'is reflected and revised. In Case B, mockup MVPs were created by the CEO to capture ', 'the idealization phase. Meanwhile, the architecture of a product was initiated by the ', 'CTO. The mockup MVP and architectural design was started at the same time and ', 'gradually became two separate tasks that reflect business requirements and technical ', 'insights. After talking to early customers, the MVP was updated according to new ', 'requirements. Consequently, the MVP became a batch of new inputs for the final product ', 'architecture: “From looking at the MVP you can see that the options for taken-away or ', 'eat-with-host is not there in our workflow. I will update it in the next meeting ...” (CTO ', 'of Company B). It is also similarly mentioned in Case E, while the CTO reflected on how ', 'they had changed the code structure based on early feedback from early stage working ', 'prototypes: “Refactoring is not too big an issue compared to benefits of early releases...” ', '(CTO of Company E). ', '', 'Facilitation of Creativity: MVP, as a rapid prototype, is more important than ideal¬ ', 'ization phase, as it gives the balance between realistic and futuristic design. In Case B, ', 'the process of finalizing a product idea has a typical path of a new product development ', 'process [2]. Several ideas were discussed from the beginning, such as mood tracking, ', 'event scheduling, e-receipt and food sharing. After many internal discussions, the focus ', 'is to create a platform that facilitates gathering with friends by sharing food. Diverged ', 'from theory, idea screening and concept testing was not really distinguished and occurs ', 'iteratively in Case B. As ideas could come from all team members, to illustrate a given ', 'concept, the CTO created a small prototype to convince other team member.

', '', 'Bridge between Business mind vs. Technical mind: MVP is used to communicate ', 'about technical detail and business idea, which often is the case of early stage startups. In ', 'Company B, a syntactic boundary occurred during an early stage of team formation by a ', 'lack of the consistent use of technical terms. A mockup MVP was used to facilitate ', 'common language: “ She is very sharp about business and finance stuffs, but it takes a ', 'long discussion to explain her about the importance of having flexible product design ...” ', '(CTO of Company B). The gap also occurs in case the product is technically complicated, ', 'as described in Company E. Technical details was too much to verbally explain in our ', 'interview, which can lead to a threat of synaptic knowledge gaps. The CTO decided to use ', 'a paper architectural diagram to hide some of the technical details, but still convey the ', 'product ideas and good level of technology. In Company A, we found a quote presenting ', 'a semantic knowledge boundary between the CEO and a developer: ‘7 asked the guy ', '(developer) to create a registration page and he has done a complicated page with all the ', 'detail ... I only need a very simple login function ...” The CEO mentioned that if a paper ', 'description was given, the mis-interpretation might not be there. ', '', 'Bridge between Entrepreneur team vs. End users: As mentioned in [3], MVP is used ', 'to validate if the entrepreneur’s ideas are the same with end user’s expectation. In ', 'Company B, the idea was to develop a platform for sharing food and food-based social ', 'gathering. Presenting the ideas to people without showing a MVP was quite difficult: ', '“We have done interviews with some friends ...by explaining key concepts like cuisine, ', 'Airbnb of food, ... which is not effective ” (CEO of Company B). Rapid prototypes, such ', 'as landing page and explainer video were proposed to communicate to a large amount ', 'of audiences: “As a suggestion for the next entrepreneurs, one things we should do ', 'from the beginning is to create a landing page. It is always difficult to follow up after ', 'interviews if you do not have a link for them ” (CTO of Company B). ', '', 'In Company C, the product serves for construction tenants, the CEO had stayed in ', 'customer organization for a period to understand gaps in the current work culture and ', 'process. At the beginning, without a MVP, the CEO had a hard time to convince ', 'customers about the benefits of her product. Syntactic knowledge gap was the barrier ', 'when the CEO needed to learn about their language. The one-feature MVP was used to ', 'show practical use of her solution: “We work with a customer organization, learn how ', 'they have worked with the current solutions and describe our proposal via the pro¬ ', 'totype. It is hard for them to realize the benefit without concrete examples... ” (CEO of ', 'Company C). ', '', 'Bridge between Entrepreneur team vs. Investors: knowledge gaps were observed not ', 'only within internal members, but also between entrepreneur teams and external ', 'stakeholders, such as vendor and investors. MVPs were used in Case E to support ', 'communication and negotiation beyond the team boundary: “A three-dimensional ', '', '', '126 ', '', '', 'A.N. Due and P. Abrahamsson ', '', '', 'prototype is always better than just a documented specification when negotiating ', 'contracts for manufacturing, support, and marketing. As a startup, you need all the ', 'leverage you can get ” (CTO company E). In Company C, MVPs were used to reduce ', 'misunderstanding between entrepreneur team and outsourcing vendor. The CEO of ', 'Company C mentioned that mockup MVP is the major mean to communicate with the ', 'development team in India: “7 can’t seat here and write about hundred page features ', 'and that not sure everyone understands .” ', '', 'Observations from investor pitches in Company B suggest that MVP is always ', 'recommended in any pitches and be a part of evaluation criteria. This is also mentioned ', 'by CEO of Company D: 66 It is important to show investors that you are committed, and ', 'past the idea stage. Without a prototype, most professional investors won’t take you ', 'seriously .” While most of investors have certain knowledge about technology and the ', 'domain, the threat can be eliminated is the pragmatic knowledge gap. The presentation ', 'can be more interesting with demonstration, and attracting interest of investors. ', '', '', '4.4 MVP as a Reusable Artifact ', '', 'Aligned with bootstrapping approaches of many software startups, MVPs need to be ', 'useful in many purposes. Even for a throw-away prototype, it can be used later in the ', 'startup processes for other purposes. ', '', 'Documentation: MVP is a way to document project progress and technical docu¬ ', 'ments. In Company B, a wireframe is implemented using JustlnMind, with concepts of ', 'layers, reusable objects and screen scenarios. The tool also provides a function to ', 'generating html versions with textual descriptions. In Company C, single feature MVP ', 'is made in a self-explained and changeable manner. It is also included architectural ', 'decisions and instruction for further extension. Besides, each prototype is an important ', 'milestone marker to quickly keep track on pivoting: “it doesn ’t matter how certain you ', 'are about your solution; it probably will take several changes soon. It’s much easier to ', 'pivot the pre-production prototype than to dispose of unsellable inventory... We can ', 'later understand why we have changed from that prototype. ” ', '', 'Growth Hacking Exploration: Prototyping is the phase where growth hacking can be ', 'experienced. Growth hacking techniques help to increase the amount of users, often ', 'require the knowledge about both marketing and software development. In Com¬ ', 'pany B, one of the early discussions was on what type of MVPs should be used in the ', 'current stage. After consulting with mentors, the team decided to use a mockup MVP ', 'that is hosted in a public server for having better reach: “We decided to use a mockup ', 'MVP, it is hosted in Google web server. The link was attached to our online ques¬ ', 'tionnaire so we can reach more people than going to each individual interview ”. In ', 'Company D, video was used in early stage to explain the concepts to large amount of ', 'customers without going into detail of sale and marketing terms. When the first ', 'one-feature MVP is available, it is freely olfered to some organizations as beta testing. ', '', 'Bootstrapping Mechanism: MVP is an economical approach of having a product, ', 'which is demonstrable to investors and early customers. In Company E, both software ', '', '', '', 'Minimum Viable Product or Multiple Facet Product? ', '', '', '127 ', '', '', 'and hardware technology is needed in the product. They adopted multiple iterations to ', 'gradually improve quality and performance of the product. It is mentioned that pro¬ ', 'totype reduces cost of final product development: “One purpose of the long prototyping ', 'process is that we can better learn about the technology. Once technical uncertainties ', 'are clear , we can start again much faster with a clean product .” (CTO of Company C). ', '', 'For startup generally, time means wasting opportunities, and would be come ', 'competitor’s advantage. In Company D, the CEO suggested that “ Don’t spend your ', 'whole development budget, before finding that you need another iteration .” Com¬ ', 'pany D composed of all technical members from the beginning: “ You could say that we ', 'have followed the Lean startup, the first MVP we have at December 2012 when we was ', 'in [Incubator place] ... We focus on the development of the MVP from Day one ” (CEO ', 'of Company C). With heavily focus on product development, they implemented the ', 'strategies that making different prototypes of the same domain area. These MVPs later ', 'can be (partly) reused by integrating into another product. CEO of Company A ', 'mentioned:\" In reality, the process of designing, building, and validating a prototype ', 'does dramatically reduce the risk, and allows everyone to hone in on the real costs of ', 'going into production ', '', '', '5 Discussion ', '', 'As a central part of build-measure-learn, Eric Ries emphasized the main role of MVP as ', 'an artifact for customer validation [3]. Based on five case studies, we found that MVPs ', 'could be useful for a startup as a design artifact, a boundary spanning artifact and a ', 'reusable artifact. The process from business ideas to a launching product consists not ', 'only loops but also parallel branches. When market validation and product design tasks ', 'are carried on at the same time, certain types of MVPs would play a role of mutual ', 'adjustment between input from customers and product design. In many cases, we ', 'observed the benefits of having MVPs on final product development, such as increase ', 'feedback quality and reachability. ', '', 'Adoption of MVP might be influenced by many contextual factors. We discussed ', 'about one most relevant factor, which is product development methodology. In our ', 'cases, Agile development is the most viable processes for software startups (in Case A, ', 'B, C, and D). In this context, fast releases with an iterative and incremental approach ', 'shorten the time from idea conception to production. The continuous integration might ', 'be the impetus for popular adopting evolutionary prototypes and single-feature MVP in ', 'our cases (Company A, B, D, E). However, the prototyping process might be hindered ', 'by other business and technical factors, leading to the inappropriateness of Agile ', 'principles sometimes during the startup process. In Company A and D, the evolu¬ ', 'tionary prototypes were implemented quite early and quickly during the process. While ', 'in Company E, the prototype is evolved gradually over months, due to the technical ', 'complexity of the product. ', '', 'Reflecting on boundary spanning theory [10, 11, 13], we observed all three types of ', 'knowledge boundary within a startup team and also between the team and external ', 'stakeholders. MVP has been shown as an effective tool to break all these gaps. Syn¬ ', 'tactic knowledge boundary was found between the CEO and a customer when ', '', '', '128 ', '', '', 'A.N. Due and P. Abrahamsson ', '', '', 'explaining the product. It seems that syntactic boundary is not the main issues in our ', 'startup cases. The reason may due to the nature of products (for wide range of users in ', 'Company A and B), the familiarity of the CEO with the industry (Company C) and the ', 'familiarity with some customers in the field (Company C, D and E). Semantic ', 'boundary was found in a conversation between CEO and a developer, which can be ', 'observed more within an entrepreneurial team. We have not found much evidence ', 'about the boundary with mentors or investors, but it might happen as well. Pragmatic ', 'boundary seems to be the most important issues among the team members and between ', 'the team and investors. This can because of the divergence of entrepreneurial team in ', 'term of startup goals and motivation over time (Company A), or pitch and presentation ', 'skill to attract interest from investors and customers (Company B). We observe at least ', 'in these cases that MVPs play the role of bridging these gaps. ', '', 'Our research revealed different ways that MVPs can be used to support startup ', 'business activities. However, they are not equally perceived among all startups. For ', 'instance, only in Case B most of the MVP usages were identified. Moreover, tactics ', 'with using MVP are arbitrary and there is no systematic approach to fully utilize the ', 'benefit of MVP. For practitioners, we suggested that the development of MVP should ', 'consider the ability to communicate among different stakeholders, to facilitate the ', 'design and to save business and product development costs. In short, MVP should be ', 'developed as a Multiple Facet Product (MFP). ', '', 'There are several threats to validities worth to discuss [15]. One internal threat of ', 'validity is the bias in data collection, as data might not represent the comprehensive ', 'story. An important issue is related to the fact that the limited number of interviews ', 'might not represent the complete scenarios in our context of study. In order to mitigate ', 'this threat we selected CTO and CEO as interviewees, who have the best understanding ', 'about their startups. We also use other types of data sources to increase our under¬ ', 'standing about the cases. With Company A and Company B, we also acted as the ', 'startup team members, which enables a lot of insights beyond interviews. Another ', 'internal threat of validity is about how reliable the reported cases are. This is ensured as ', 'two of the authors have not only theoretical background about software startups but ', 'also hand-on experience. ', '', 'A construct threat of validity is a possible inadequate description of constructs. ', 'During the coding of interview transcripts, we adopted explanatory descriptive labels ', 'for theoretical categories, to capture the underlying phenomenon without losing rele¬ ', 'vant details. An external threat of validity is the representativeness of our selected ', 'cases. As discussed earlier, the sample is collected from European technical-founded ', 'bootstrap startups. A startup from USA or America, and a startup with different ', 'financial models might introduce other MVP usage patterns. For more thorough ', 'understanding and generalization of the results, a large pool of startups with variety ', 'profiles should be included. All of the cases are small startups under development ', 'seeking for seed funding. Besides, the startup decisions on MVP might be influenced ', 'by individual personalities.

One of the goals of DevOps is to foster better col¬ ', 'laboration between development and operations personnel, in order to ', 'improve organizational efficiency. Since DevOps is lacking a common def¬ ', 'inition, there are several approaches to adopt it, and organizations largely ', 'need to determine how to apply DevOps for themselves. In this paper, ', 'we present results from a case study in which a software organization ', 'adopts DevOps. The focus of this research is to study the impact of mix¬ ', 'ing the responsibilities between development and operations engineers.

DevOps addresses the challenge of what is often described as a gap between ', 'development and operations personnel. The gap is reduced through a combi¬ ', 'nation of processes, cultural enhancements, and supporting technologies. More ', 'specifically, DevOps encompasses automation for reducing manual effort and ', 'improving stability, continuous feedback using metrics for improving software ', 'development processes, and a culture of collaboration and information sharing ', 'between teams [2]. However, the term “DevOps” is still an ambiguous concept ', 'and is lacking a standard definition [3-5]. While the purpose of DevOps is clear, ', 'organizations adopting DevOps must interpret and define what DevOps means ', 'to them. ', '', 'The fact that DevOps is lacking a standard definition implies that there is ', 'no simple approach to follow when adopting DevOps in an organization.

Since DevOps focuses on principles for software and service development, ', 'rather than specifying exactly how to implement DevOps, it means the path to a ', 'successful DevOps adoption is unique to each organization [6]. Therefore, we feel ', 'that it can be beneficial to learn from the successes and challenges experienced ', 'during previous DevOps adoptions when planning new DevOps initiatives. ', '', 'In this article, we present how a particular organization adopted DevOps ', 'and what the impact was of this adoption from the perspective of engineers. In ', 'particular, we study the impact of mixing responsibilities between development ', 'and operations personnel, and how this affects the culture, tools and work prac¬ ', 'tices. The study was carried out by interviewing both development (“Devs”) and ', 'operations (“Ops”) personnel before the start of the DevOps adoption and six ', 'months into the adoption. ', '', '2 Background: Approaches to DevOps Adoption ', '', 'DevOps is commonly viewed as a professional movement that emphasizes com¬ ', 'munication, collaboration and integration between software developers and IT ', 'operations, see e.g. [7]. According to Willis [8], DevOps is comprised of four key ', 'aspects: culture , automation , measurement and sharing. In our previous work [9], ', 'we described DevOps as a number of engineering process capabilities supported ', 'by certain cultural and technological enablers. According to this definition, the ', 'capabilities define processes that an organization should be able to carry out, ', 'while the enablers support efficient work execution of these processes. ', '', 'Common to most definitions of DevOps is that one of the main goals behind ', 'it is to tackle the problem of having development and operations teams in func¬ ', 'tional silos (see e.g. [10]) - a problem which is often present in non-DevOps soft¬ ', 'ware development organizations. The teams are in functional silos when there ', 'is little support for communication and collaboration between them in order ', 'to make releases. Breaking down the silos improves the development cycle, by ', 'bringing Devs and Ops closer to each other, allowing the organization to produce ', 'more production-ready code and deliver better services more frequently. Break¬ ', 'ing down existing silos is, however, a non-trivial task, and it is tightly coupled ', 'with improvements in work processes, culture, and technology. ', '', 'Focusing on concrete actions that address the problem of bringing Devs and ', 'Ops closer to each other, three possible but distinct approaches are to ', '', '1. Mix responsibilities: assign both development and operations responsibilities ', 'to all engineers, or ', '', '2. Mix personnel: increase communication and collaboration between Dev and ', 'Ops, but keep existing roles differentiated, or ', '', '3. Bridge team: create a separate DevOps team that functions as a bridge ', 'between Devs and Ops ', '', 'Which approach to use may be difficult to decide on. An argument for fol¬ ', 'lowing Approach 1 (mix responsibilities) lies in the concept of Infrastructure ', '', '', 'On the Impact of Mixing Responsibilities Between Devs and Ops 133 ', '', '', 'as Code. What this concept refers to is that the infrastructure for deploying ', 'software is fully automated, and is controlled by code. As mentioned in [11]: ', '', '“If infrastructure is code, then almost by definition, infrastructure becomes ', 'to some degree a function of development, or at least so hard to separate ', 'from development that the distinction becomes almost irrelevant.” ', '', 'Assuming that infrastructure is code, this statement suggests that Approach 1 ', '(mix responsibilities) is a natural approach, because Ops will be involved in Dev ', 'tasks by developing the infrastructure together with the Devs. ', '', 'As for Approach 2 (mix personnel), it is stated in [12] that creating cross¬ ', 'functional teams is a good approach when adopting DevOps. These teams should ', 'consist of Devs, testers, Ops personnel and others, and then each of them would ', 'contribute code to a shared repository. In this way, the Dev and Ops responsibili¬ ', 'ties are maintained, but communication and collaboration is promoted. It is also ', 'mentioned in [12] that although promoting communication and collaboration is ', 'key, training for Devs and Ops on the responsibilities of other departments can ', 'be very beneficial for communication. ', '', 'In a blog post [10], Jez Humble strongly states that Approach 3 (bridge ', 'team) should not be followed when adopting DevOps, since a separate DevOps ', 'team will not break any silos, but instead create new ones. Nevertheless, [13] ', 'reports that DevOps departments are a growing trend, and that according to ', 'their survey, more than 90 percent of those working in DevOps departments are ', 'in companies with medium to high IT performance. ', '', '3 Research Questions and Study Design ', '', 'We consider that there is a need for empirical studies describing how DevOps is ', 'being adopted in different organizations and for the benefits and drawbacks of ', 'adopting DevOps. In this article, we decided to focus on the DevOps approach ', 'based on mixing responsibilities, and left studies of other approaches for future ', 'work. The main research question is as follows ', '', 'RQ What may happen when mixing responsibilities between developers and ', 'operations teams in an existing organization? ', '', 'RQ.a How does this approach affect the culture? ', '', 'RQ.b How does this approach affect the tooling? ', '', 'RQ.c How does this approach affect the ways of working? ', '', 'This research was done as a longitudinal case study: we observed an organi¬ ', 'zation as the phenomenon happened. For collecting data for the study, we used ', 'semi-structured interviews of company employees. For selecting the organization ', 'for the case study, we had the following two criteria: ', '', '1. Before the start of the DevOps adoption, there has to be clearly separated ', 'roles between Devs and Ops in the organization ', '', '2. The organization chooses Approach 1 as part of their DevOps adoption ', '', '', '134 K. Nybom et al. ', '', '', 'The selected organization was an international IT company with a long his¬ ', 'tory and over 1000 employees, which develops both software and services for cus¬ ', 'tomers. The case organization contains several organizational units, each having ', 'their own R&D teams. These units are combined by a separate operations unit. ', '', 'This study was carried out in one of the organizational units, which develops ', 'and operates in the cloud services area. That unit was also the only unit in the ', 'organization that was actively adopting DevOps. Motivations for the adoption ', 'were to make software deployments faster and more frequent, to share knowledge ', 'between development and operations, and to keep deployment costs low. ', '', 'A total of 14 experienced employees were selected by the company so they ', 'would represent different work areas, e.g. development, quality assurance, opera¬ ', 'tions, and management. Their familiarity with DevOps prior to the study varied ', 'from understanding the basics of the concept to having previous professional ', 'experience of successfully adopting DevOps. ', '', 'We conducted two rounds of interviews. The first interviews were conducted ', 'in the end of May 2014. Before the interviews, the participants were informed ', 'about the study, that the interviews will be recorded and that the answers will ', 'be handled anonymously. The interviews lasted roughly 45 min on average. An ', 'interview guide containing a broad field of questions was used for the semi- ', 'structured interviews. The purpose of the first round of interviews was to get ', 'an overview of the organization, of their processes, of the daily work, and of ', 'employees’ expectations and concerns regarding their DevOps adoption. The ', 'recordings of the interviews were transcribed, coded and analyzed, and some ', 'results from that round have been reported in [9]. ', '', 'The second round of interviews were conducted in October 2014, and followed ', 'the same procedure as the first round. The questions for the second round were ', 'designed based on the results from the first round, and many of them were angled ', 'to expose changes since the first round. Other topics covered were related to the ', 'software development processes, relationship between development and opera¬ ', 'tions, teamwork, employees’ feelings (such as pressure, impact and importance ', 'regarding his/her work), how the DevOps adoption had proceeded along with ', 'expectations and concerns, views on the management, and the DevOps aspects ', 'of automation and familiarity with others’ work. ', '', 'The recordings from the second round were transcribed. Thereafter they ', 'were coded separately by two of the researchers to make sure that no relevant ', 'information would be missed, and to reduce the risk of researcher subjectivity ', 'influencing the codes. The researchers used slightly different approaches to code ', 'the material. The first coding approach was as follows. First, the transcripts were ', 'read though and summarized to obtain a quick overview of the subjects discussed ', 'in the interviews. Then, the transcripts were read through in detail with the ', 'researcher identifying, assigning, comparing and adjusting codes according to ', 'the content. Finally, the transcripts and the corresponding coding were read ', 'through once more from the start to check and make some final adjustments to ', 'the codes. ', '', 'A second coding approach was to use pre-defined codes according to the ', 'research questions in this article. While reading through the transcripts and ', '', '', 'On the Impact of Mixing Responsibilities Between Devs and Ops 135 ', '', '', 'assigning content to the codes, different subjects discussed during the interviews ', 'were simultaneously identified. A second round of coding was then done within ', 'each of the pre-defined codes, using the identified subjects as pre-defined sub¬ ', 'codes. This resulted in detailed codes for each research question. The researchers ', 'then individually identified what was perceived as beneficial or challenging from ', 'both coding approaches. The individual lists were then compared, discussed and ', 'merged into our final list of outcomes. The results presented in this article are ', 'based on the second round of interviews. ', '', '4 Results ', '', 'Before presenting the outcomes of the interviews, it is worth mentioning that ', 'the organizational structure, or more specifically, the fact that operations were ', 'attending the products for all the different organizational units, had an impact on ', 'several of the things mentioned below. Most notably, this resulted in operations ', 'having limited possibilities in taking on development responsibilities. Another ', 'fact to notice is that only one of the organizational units were actively adopting ', 'DevOps, while the other units were not, resulting in a difficult situation for ', 'operations: depending on which unit they were attending, they needed to work ', 'according to a specific pattern. ', '', 'In the following we use the terms “Dev” and “Ops” to describe engineers with ', 'previous experience and responsibilities within software and service development ', 'and operations respectively. ', '', '', '4.1 Impact on Culture ', '', 'A New Source for Friction. In order to enable Devs to deal with operations ', 'tasks, it was necessary to give administration rights to Devs to different environ¬ ', 'ments. Based on the comments from the employees, it was evident that gaining ', 'access served as a cause for friction and mistrust. It was also mentioned that the ', 'process for obtaining access was long and tedious. ', '', 'The long process also had negative implications on the work efficiency, ', 'because employees often realized too late that they needed the access, caus¬ ', 'ing extra delays. The decision process for who was granted the access was also ', 'described as unfair. Some employees mention that access seem to have been ', 'granted based on shown interest rather on experience and knowledge. Devs also ', 'complained about Ops getting access faster than Devs. This made them angry ', 'and irritated. ', '', '', 'An Eye-Opening Experience. Mixing the responsibilities of Devs and Ops ', 'was considered educating for the Devs. In the organization, the Devs had been ', 'developing various tools for their operations personnel to use for a long time, ', 'but only now with the DevOps adoption initiative did they get to see how their ', 'own tools were working. ', '', '', '', '136 K. Nybom et al. ', '', '', 'Seeing the operations side also surprised the Devs in the sense that they now ', 'realized how far from production ready their software usually was, although it ', 'had passed all the tests in their own environment. ', '', 'Through teaching others and learning from others, Devs and Ops were begin¬ ', 'ning to trust each other more. The increased level of trust was accompanied with ', 'stress relief, specifically for operations personnel as they could trust Devs to ', 'do part of the operations tasks. As a consequence, knowledge about operations ', 'tasks and problems were increased among the Devs. This lead to Devs starting to ', 'improve test environments to better correspond with production environments, ', 'while also contributing to increased collaboration between Devs and Ops. ', '', 'Learning how to do operations tasks was not straightforward for everyone. ', 'Some employees mention it being extremely challenging, and that they did not ', 'see the point in having Devs do tasks which other more proficient employees ', 'do better. The complications in learning how to do operations tasks resulted ', 'in a certain reluctance in learning new things among the Devs. These Devs ', 'mentioned that they would prefer having the distinction between Devs and Ops ', 'more clear, implying that the mixing of responsibilities were not to their liking. ', 'Additionally, learning how to do upgrades was considered time consuming, but ', 'on the positive side, it had also revealed flaws in the upgrade processes. Devs ', 'mentioned the greater need for knowledge and expertise, since they now were ', 'responsible for everything and consequently needed to know every technology ', 'used. This was visible as mixed feelings among the Devs. ', '', '', 'Shared Responsibilities. The view on how responsibilities were shared var¬ ', 'ied. Devs largely felt that responsibilities were shared, and if something went ', 'wrong, it was everybody’s fault, while some Ops felt that Devs were somewhat ', 'unaccountable, specifically when it came to fixing problems late in the evenings. ', 'Their opinion was that Devs wanted to decide on everything, how the product is ', 'designed, how it is deployed, etc., without involving operations personnel. Then ', 'at the end of regular office hours, Devs would not care anymore and would want ', 'Ops to take care of it. ', '', 'Employees agreed that within development, the responsibility of deploying ', 'software was shared among the Devs. They mentioned that whenever someone ', 'had problems with deploying software, they simply needed to shout it out, and ', 'everyone was alert and helping that person if needed. ', '', '', 'Improved Collaboration. Mixing the responsibilities brought Devs and Ops ', 'closer to each other. Employees mentioned that Devs and Ops now collaborate on ', 'different tasks, since they now realize the importance of collaboration. Everyone ', 'agreed that collaboration between Devs and Ops is good on an individual level, ', 'and to some extent also on team level, but some employees called on the support ', 'from managers to further improve collaboration by providing more reasons for ', 'collaboration. It was mentioned that through the improved collaboration, it was ', 'easier to get things moving forward, since Devs could discuss directly their issues ', 'with Ops personnel, which is much faster than having to contact managers to ', 'get the issues solved. ', '', '', '', 'On the Impact of Mixing Responsibilities Between Devs and Ops 137 ', '', '', 'On the other hand, Ops felt uneasy about Devs coming into their domain, ', 'and mentioned that adjusting to this takes time. Additionally, the closer col¬ ', 'laboration and specifically keeping Devs and Ops synchronized was described ', 'being time consuming. It was argued that, although individual, the work space ', 'affects the level of collaboration to some degree, since long walking distances ', 'might imply a threshold for going to talk to some other person. ', '', 'Through the collaboration, both Devs and Ops had become more trusting and ', 'understanding towards the other. Ops had seen that Devs can do the operations ', 'tasks without jeopardizing service stability and Devs had realized what Ops have ', 'to struggle with in order to deploy their software. ', '', '', '4.2 Impact on Internal Development Tools ', '', 'Awareness of Tool Quality. As mentioned earlier, Devs had been developing ', 'tools for their operations personnel, and now that Devs were dealing with oper¬ ', 'ations tasks, they were using their own tools. Devs mentioned that they were ', 'now experiencing the flaws and problems that the tools had, something which ', 'Ops had been aware of all the time. But now that Devs were using their own ', 'tools, and since they were not accustomed to having poor solutions, they were ', 'putting extra effort into creating very good tools for deployment. Development ', 'of these improved tools was performed in collaboration with Ops. ', '', '', 'Deployment Risks. Previously operations was the place where the entire ser¬ ', 'vice stack came together, where all problems materialized, and where decisions ', 'were made which affected the entire service stack. Since Devs had been given ', 'the power to deploy their own product, there was some concern that they could ', 'make decisions that would be optimal for their specific product, while unknow¬ ', 'ingly disregarding the impact of their decisions on the remaining service stack. ', 'The main risk identified was that problems caused by these kinds of decisions ', 'are realized too late. ', '', '', 'Identified Tooling Obstacles. It was mentioned that the many environments ', 'and many ways of upgrading different services creates an obstacle for full automa¬ ', 'tion. Ops mentioned that automatic reactions to various glitches that may occur ', 'cannot be defined. Ops always have to investigate those problems manually. ', 'These problems were partially realized by Devs too. They perceived deploy¬ ', 'ment as being time consuming and requiring significant effort, and while they ', 'technically could create scripts that would deploy everything, the real problem ', 'was to create scripts that recover from glitches. Another concern mentioned was ', 'that without automation, configuring all the different environments correctly ', 'is error-prone, specifically when there is a change in configuration. The Devs ', 'felt that it is easy to forget to align the configurations across all the different ', 'environments. ', '', '', '', '138 K. Nybom et al. ', '', '', '4.3 Impact on Ways of Working ', '', 'Added Responsibilities. According to the chosen DevOps adoption approach, ', 'Devs were now responsible for performing upgrades on certain production envi¬ ', 'ronments. These environments were pre-staging environments, in the sense that ', 'they were mostly for internal users. A so called build master role was introduced ', 'among the Devs, which would rotate within the team on a weekly basis. In addi¬ ', 'tion to doing the upgrades, the build master was also required to debug and ', 'investigate the production environment. ', '', 'Devs mentioned that getting used to the build master role, and focusing on it ', 'was demanding - it is easy for Devs to start working on something else as soon ', 'as they have completed their task as build master, even though they noticed ', 'something that should be fixed. ', '', 'Benefits of Having Administration Rights. The perceived benefits of ', 'Devs having access to different environments were manifold. Getting e.g. statis¬ ', 'tics from the production environments was described being considerably easier ', 'through the granted access, making work much smoother. Devs mentioned that ', 'it also allows better debugging, because Devs do not need to ask Ops for help ', 'anymore. It is faster, and more thorough, because Ops do not always have time ', 'to delve into the problems. On the other hand, this is time away from feature ', 'development. Ops also said that they had many times received help from Devs ', 'in problematic situations, making their work easier. ', '', '', 'Common Ways of Working. Employees mentioned that the mixing of respon¬ ', 'sibilities puts higher requirements on common work practices and technical solu¬ ', 'tions between Devs and Ops. Without this, a risk identified was that Devs create ', 'tools specific for only their own unit’s needs rather than having common solutions ', 'for all the organization. They mentioned that the upper management needs to push ', 'for common solutions in order to avoid this situation. They also mentioned that ', 'without strong management, the increased freedom among the Devs may result in ', 'a chaotic working environment, where everyone is doing as he or she pleases. ', '', 'A concern was that even though access had been granted to Devs and employ¬ ', 'ees had new responsibilities, work was done quite far in the same way as earlier. ', 'Other concerns among the Ops were that with added responsibilities and granted ', 'access for the Devs, Ops responsibilities had changed towards support, and that ', 'Devs were making decisions without consulting Ops. ', '', 'Devs occasionally dealing with operations tasks was mentioned to have neg¬ ', 'ative implications on the employees’ work flow, as they caused complicated con¬ ', 'text switches. They said that it is easy to switch between tasks when they are ', 'within the same area, but switching between development and operations tasks ', 'is complicated. These context switches were perceived as frustrating. ', '', '', 'Concerns with Mixed Responsibilities. Several concerns in the chosen app¬ ', 'roach of adopting DevOps were also discussed. It was mentioned that people like ', '', '', '', 'On the Impact of Mixing Responsibilities Between Devs and Ops 139 ', '', '', 'to do what they are used to doing. Thus, introducing operations tasks to Devs ', 'was perceived as complicated, and Devs would try to avoid them. Devs were ', 'used to making their own engineering decisions, but this was described as prob¬ ', 'lematic, since they now created their own solutions also for operations tasks, ', 'instead of learning from others and reusing common solutions. ', '', 'The combined effort of Devs and Ops was described having its own complica¬ ', 'tions, because more people making changes to configuration and software leads ', 'to an increase in the probability of error, simply because the tools and processes ', 'for performing such changes have not emerged. To cope with this situation, ', 'employees felt that there is a great need for guidance, and will for involvement ', 'from everyone, so that they can agree on a common approach. ', '', 'Devs doing operation tasks was experienced both positively and negatively. ', 'Some people loved having control over the entire delivery chain, while others ', 'wondered why not more experienced people could take care of the deployment. ', 'Several employees felt, however, that the chosen approach of mixing responsi¬ ', 'bilities was the wrong approach for doing DevOps. A perceived problem was ', 'that technical systems were tied to specific APIs and then Devs and different ', 'development teams were given too much freedom in choosing their own way of ', 'doing things. With many such development teams, a risk mentioned was that ', 'the organization ends up with many ways of working, causing lack of synergy. ', '', '5 Discussion ', '', 'The results from the interviews indicate several beneficial aspects when mixing ', 'responsibilities between Devs and Ops. Devs have seen what work is required in ', 'order to deploy their software, which is educating for them. In addition to allow¬ ', 'ing them to develop more production ready code, it also reveals problems and ', 'flaws in some of the tools they have developed for the Ops. As a consequence, ', 'Devs are now putting more effort into developing better tools, which is done in ', 'collaboration with Ops. This clearly shows a benefit of learning about responsi¬ ', 'bilities of other teams. When Devs learn what happens with their code after it is ', 'developed and tested, they can exploit this knowledge for producing better code ', 'in the future. Unfortunately, corresponding benefits for the operations personnel ', 'were not revealed, because they were unable to take on development responsi¬ ', 'bilities. This was mainly due to the organizational structure, which required the ', 'operations teams to deal with software from all the organizational units. ', '', 'Both the collaboration and trust between Devs and Ops is improved through ', 'the mixed responsibilities. Instead of contacting managers to solve problems, ', 'employees can discuss directly with personnel from the other team which is much ', 'faster. Ops have realized that Devs can deal with the operations tasks they are ', 'assigned with, without jeopardizing the stability of the service. Devs, on the other ', 'hand, have seen what Ops have to go through in order to deploy their software. ', 'This weakens the silo structure between the Devs and Ops, and the teams are ', 'effectively collaborating more. The weakened silos also inspire employees for ', 'even more collaboration, and some employees said that they would want the ', '', '', '', '140 K. Nybom et al. ', '', '', 'managers to give them even more reasons for collaboration. Thus, mixing the ', 'responsibilities seems to weaken the silos, as Devs and Ops are encouraged, and ', 'even required, to communicate and collaborate more. ', '', 'Giving administration rights to Devs was seen as beneficial in many ways. ', 'Devs get statistics from production environments making work smoother, they ', 'can fix errors more easily than previously, and fixing errors is more thorough and ', 'efficient. The drawback is that all of this is time away from feature development. ', '', 'The chosen adoption approach was not without complications. Surprisingly, ', 'getting administration rights was described as a source for friction, since employ¬ ', 'ees felt that administration rights were not granted on a fair basis. Dealing with ', 'operations tasks was far from an easy task for several Devs, and because of this, ', 'the opinion of having separate responsibilities was strengthened among them. ', 'The organizational structure prevented Ops to fully take part in the DevOps ', 'adoption, since they already had their hands tied with operations tasks for ', 'other organizational units. We believe that this fact also partially prevented ', 'the teams from developing common ways of working, since Ops also had to work ', 'with other units that were not adopting DevOps. The concerns associated with ', 'taking on operations tasks among the Devs are a natural reaction. It is under¬ ', 'standable that they wonder why they have to deal with operations tasks when ', 'there already is more proficient personnel to deal with those tasks. In general, a ', 'certain reluctance towards the adoption of DevOps was observed. ', '', 'Devs having the power to deploy their own software was repeatedly men¬ ', 'tioned as dangerous because this could potentially damage the entire service ', 'stack in the organization. The reason is that Devs were not aware of software ', 'developed in other organizational units, and consequently were configuring their ', 'software without those in mind. This presents a risk with the adoption app¬ ', 'roach, because if other organizational units had had similar power, it could have ', 'produced a chaotic end result, where all units would create their own solutions. ', 'With a lack of collaboration, communication and shared work practices and goals ', 'between Devs and Ops, this risk is further strengthened. To improve the situ¬ ', 'ation, management could actively try to improve inter-team relations in order ', 'to facilitate communication to ensure that information spreads across teams. ', 'Automation could also assist in solving this problem to some degree. ', '', 'Creating fully automated deployment tools was mentioned being a neces¬ ', 'sity for a well-functioning DevOps implementation. With the many different ', 'environments and many ways of upgrading, employees were of the opinion that ', 'automatic reactions to various glitches that may occur cannot be defined. Con¬ ', 'sequently, a large effort was continuously put into configuring and upgrading ', 'software, and employees called for a holistically well-functioning deployment ', 'tool chain. The effort required to put into this also had other implications, since ', 'it required Devs to make complicated context switches between development ', 'and operations tasks. Better automation could have assisted with the context ', 'switches, improving the work flow of the employees. ', '', 'When both Devs and Ops independently make changes to configuration and ', 'software, there is a greater probability of error, as long as the tools and processes ', 'for performing such changes are not improved. This clearly shows the need for ', 'developing common ways of working and improving the automation. ', '', '', '', 'On the Impact of Mixing Responsibilities Between Devs and Ops 141 ', '', '', 'It is clear from the respondents that what DevOps means to the organiza¬ ', 'tion should be clearly communicated to the employees in order to support a ', 'successful adoption. Currently, Devs felt that DevOps mostly meant that they ', 'get additional operations tasks to deal with once in a while, and when they are ', 'completed, they go back to developing. Clearly, this view is counterproductive ', 'for improving collaboration between the teams, and to avoid this, guidance and ', 'instructions are a necessity. ', '', 'Had a third round of interviews been performed later into the adoption ', 'process, it is likely that the collaboration between the teams had been further ', 'improved, and that DevOps had stabilized more. When the second round of ', 'interviews was performed, however, employees were still adapting to the new ', 'responsibilities. Since people change slowly, it is not surprising to see certain ', 'instability, uncertainty, and reluctance among the employees. ', '', '6 Conclusions ', '', 'This paper describes phenomena that arose when mixing responsibilities between ', 'developers and operations personnel in an organization when adopting DevOps. ', 'The results are from a case study, in which a software organization adopting ', 'DevOps was studied. The case organization consisted of several organizational ', 'units and a separate operations unit. In the organization only one organiza¬ ', 'tional unit was adopting DevOps, which impacted the results in the sense that ', 'operations were not fully able to participate in the adoption. ', '', 'The results indicate several benefits of the mixed responsibilities. Collab¬ ', 'oration and trust were improved between Devs and Ops, and seeing what the ', 'other team has to deal with was very educating, helping employees in their work. ', 'Through increased collaboration, the work flow was described as smoother and ', 'faster as compared to earlier. Since Devs were dealing with operations tasks, ', 'they realized problems and flaws in the tools that they had earlier developed for ', 'operations, and Devs were now working on improving the tooling. ', '', 'Several complications with the chosen adoption approach were also revealed. ', 'As Devs had the power to configure and deploy their own software, a major ', 'concern was that they would create solutions that were optimal for their soft¬ ', 'ware, while unknowingly disregarding the impact this had on the remaining ', 'service stack. The lack of common ways of working between Devs and Ops ', 'reinforced this concern. Dealing with new responsibilities among the Devs was ', 'considered challenging by many, and even strengthened their opinion of having ', 'separate responsibilities. Because of the challenging operations tasks, Devs real¬ ', 'ized the importance of having automated infrastructure, but accomplishing this ', 'was described as being extremely complicated in the case organization. ', '', 'Finally, the study reveals the need for a strong management when adopting ', 'DevOps, since Devs and Ops need to develop common goals, practices of deploy¬ ', 'ing, and approaches to technical solutions. The management also needs to clearly ', 'communicate to the employees what DevOps means to the organization, so that ', 'the personnel will realize the reason for the adoption, and the requirements and ', '', '', '', '142 K. Nybom et al. ', '', '', 'benefits of it. Automation of the infrastructure is of key importance, specifically ', 'when Devs are given the responsibility of configuring and deploying their own ', 'software. ', '', 'The results indicate that when operations work with several organizational ', 'units, it is challenging to adopt DevOps in only some of those units. Thus, the ', 'overall organizational structure may impact the DevOps adoption process. ', '', '', 'Acknowledgements.

Developers build an artefact that will be ', 'executed on a machine; software metrics, design patterns, micro patterns and ', 'good practices help to increase the quality of a software [4,6], but developers are ', 'humans and prone to human sensitivities. Coordinating and structuring devel¬ ', 'oper teams is a vital activity for software companies [IT] and dynamics within a ', 'team have a direct influence on group success; on the other hand, social aspects ', 'are intangible elements which, if monitored, can help the team in reaching its ', 'goals. Researchers are increasingly focusing their effort on understanding how ', 'the human aspects of a technical discipline can affect the final results [3,7,11]. ', '', 'Open-source development usually involves developers that voluntarily partic¬ ', 'ipate in a project by contributing with code. The management of such develop¬ ', 'ers could even be more complex than the management of a team within a com¬ ', 'pany, since developers are not in the same place at the same time and coordination ', 'becomes more difficult. The absence of face-to-face communication mandates the ', 'use of mailing lists, electronic boards, or specific tools such as Issue Tracking Sys¬ ', 'tems. Being rude when writing a comment or replying to a contributor can affect ', 'the cohesion of the group and the successfulness of a project; equally a respectful ', 'environment is an incentive for new contributors joining the project [13,20,24]. ', '', 'In this paper, we empirically analyze more than 500 K comments from Ortu ', 'et al.

We empiri¬ ', 'cally built three Markov chain models with states for politeness (polite, neutral, ', 'impolite), sentiment (positive, neutral, negative), and emotions (joy, anger, love, ', 'sadness).

The authors demonstrated that emotions did ', 'have an effect on the issue fixing time. Steinmacher et al. [22] analyzed social bar¬ ', 'riers that obstructed first contributions of newcomers (new developers joining an ', 'open-source project). The study indicated how impolite answers were considered ', 'as a barrier by newcomers. These barriers were identified through a systematic ', 'literature review, responses collected from open source project contributors and ', 'students contributing to open source projects. Rigby et al. [20] analyzed, using a ', 'psychometrically-based linguistic analysis tool, the five big personality traits of ', 'software developers in the Apache httpd server mailing list. The authors found ', 'that the two developers that were responsible for the major Apache releases had ', 'similar personalities and their personalities were different from other developers. ', 'Bazzelli et al. [1] analyzed questions and answers on stackoverflow.com to deter¬ ', 'mine the developer personality traits, using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count ', '[19]. The authors found that the top reputed authors were more extroverted and ', 'expressed less negative emotions than authors of down voted posts. Gomez et al. ', '[9] performed an experiment to evaluate whether the level of extraversion in a ', 'team influenced the final quality of the software products obtained and the sat¬ ', 'isfaction perceived while this work was being carried out. Results indicated that ', 'when forming work teams, project managers should carry out a personality test ', 'in order to balance the amount of extraverted team members with those who are ', 'not extraverted. This would permit the team members to feel satisfied with the ', 'work carried out by the team without reducing the quality of the software prod¬ ', 'ucts developed. ', '', 'Compared to the existing literature, the goal of this paper is to build Markov ', 'chain models which describe how developers interact in a distributed Agile envi¬ ', 'ronment evaluating politeness, sentiment and emotions.

', '', '5 Threats to Validity ', '', 'Several threats to validity need to be considered. Threats to external validity ', 'are related to generalisation of our conclusions.

Commercial software is typically ', 'developed using different platforms and technologies, with strict deadlines and ', 'cost limitations and by developers with different experience. Politeness, senti¬ ', 'ment and emotions measures are approximations given the challenges of natural ', 'language and subtle phenomena like sarcasm. To deal with these threats, we used ', 'SentiStrength form measuring sentiment, Danescu et al.’s politeness tool [5] and ', 'Ortu et al. [15] for measuring politeness. This is a threat to construct validity. ', 'Threats to internal validity concern confounding factors that could influence the ', 'obtained results. Since the comments used in this study were collected over an ', 'extended period from developers unaware of being subject to analysis, we are ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Arsonists or Firefighters? Affectiveness in Agile Software Development 153 ', '', '', 'confident that the emotions we mined are genuine. This study is focused on ', 'text written by agile developers for developers. To correctly depict the affective¬ ', 'ness embedded in such comments, it is necessary to understand the developers’ ', 'dictionary and slang. This assumption is supported by Murgia et al. [13] for mea¬ ', 'suring emotions. We are confident that the tools used for measuring sentiment ', 'and politeness however are equally reliable in the software engineering domain ', 'as in other domains. ', '', '6 Conclusions and Future Work ', '', 'This paper presented an analysis of more than 500 K comments from open-source ', 'issue tracking system repositories. We empirically determined how agile develop¬ ', 'ers interacted with each other under certain psychological conditions generated ', 'by politeness, sentiment and emotions of a comment posted on a issue tracking ', 'system. Results showed that when in the presence of impolite or negative com¬ ', 'ments, there is higher probability for the next comment to be neutral or polite ', '(neutral or positive in case of sentiment) than impolite or negative. This fact ', 'demonstrates that developers, in the dataset considered for this study, tended ', 'to resolve conflicts instead of increasing negativity within the communication ', 'flow. This is not true when we consider emotions; negative emotions are more ', 'likely to be followed by negative emotions than positive. Markov models pro¬ ', 'vide a mathematical description of developer behavioural aspects and the result ', 'could help managers take control the development phases of a system (expe- ', 'cially in a distributed environment), since social aspects can seriously affect a ', 'developer’s productivity. As future works we plan to investigate possible links ', 'existing between software metrics and emotions, to better understand the impact ', 'of affectiveness on software quality.

Kanban tends to focus on fast ', 'production, rapid and continual user feedback and interaction [1]. ', '', 'Used for controlling the logistical chain from a production point of view, Kanban ', 'was developed and applied in the Japanese manufacturing industry in the 1950s [1]. ', 'Kanban’s success in the manufacturing industry has convinced software engineers to ', 'adopt this approach, with practitioner-driven support furthering this trend. In 2004, ', 'David Anderson introduced Kanban to a small IT team at Microsoft, aiming to help the ', 'team members visualise their work and put limits on their work in progress (WIP). ', 'Kanban has five underlying principles [7], the so-called Kanban properties [10]: ', 'visualise the workflow, limit work in progress, measure and manage flow, make pro¬ ', 'cess policies explicit and use models to recognise improvement and opportunities. ', '', '© The Author(s) 2016 ', '', 'H. Sharp and T. Hall (Eds.): XP 2016, LNBIP 251, pp. 156-168, 2016. ', '', 'DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-33515-5_13 ', '', '', 'Insights into the Perceived Benefits of Kanban ', '', '', '157 ', '', '', 'The motivation behind visualisation and limiting WIP was to identify the con¬ ', 'straints of the process and to focus on a single item at a time. Additionally, instead of ', 'pushing work on to software developers, Kanban promotes a pull approach: when a ', 'team member finishes an existing task, he or she automatically pulls the next item to ', 'begin work. In brief, Kanban aims to provide visibility to the software development ', 'process, communicate priorities and highlight bottlenecks [5]. This process results in a ', 'constant flow of releasing work items to customers, as the developers focus only on a ', 'few items at a given time [6]. The proliferation of Kanban in software engineering ', 'boomed after the publication of key books. These seminal books included David ', 'Anderson’s Kanban [10], which introduces the concept of Kanban in systems and ', 'software development, and Corey Lada’s Scrumban [23], which discusses the fusion of ', 'Scrum and Kanban. The key motivation for Kanban use involves a focus on flow and ', 'the omission of the obligatory iteration cycles in Scrum. ', '', 'Kanban has received considerable attention from some organisations; others remain ', 'reluctant to adopt it. So far, there have been few scientific studies [1,6, 33] addressing ', 'Kanban usage in software organisations, and none of the existing studies report on ', 'practitioners’ perceptions of it. Earlier Kanban studies report a number of challenges in ', 'its use and adoption, such as organisational, social and technical issues. These studies ', 'introduce Kanban as a new way to develop software and systems. Research is still ', 'required to identify factors that might influence its effective usage in organisations. ', 'Therefore, this study aims to investigate factors that practitioners deem to be important ', 'in Kanban use. Conducted in 2015, the study includes Kanban practitioners from the ', 'LeanKanban Linkedln community. LeanKanban is one of the biggest social media ', 'communities of professionals who use Kanban at their organisations. ', '', 'The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 explains the research ', 'strategy and data collection method, while Sect. 3 provides the results. Section 4 ', 'presents validity threats before moving into Sect. 5, which concludes the paper with ', 'recommendations for future research. ', '', '', '2 Research Strategy and Methods ', '', 'In this section, we first introduce the theoretical model adopted as a basis for designing ', 'the empirical research. The discussion continues with the survey design and data ', 'collection process. ', '', '', '2.1 Theoretical Model ', '', 'As shown in Fig. 1, we adopted Dyba et al. [8] model which is an extension of ', 'Riemenschneider et al. [9] research model in order to explore practitioners’ perceptions ', 'regarding Kanban use. ', '', 'Riemenschneider et al. [9] explain software developers’ acceptance of method¬ ', 'ologies by comparing five well-known and established theoretical models: the Tech¬ ', 'nology Acceptance Model (TAM), TAM2 (an extension of TAM), Perceived ', 'Characteristics of Innovating, Theory of Planned Behaviour and Model of Personal ', '', '', '158 ', '', '', 'M.O. Ahmad et al. ', '', '', '', 'Fig. 1. Conceptual model ', '', '', 'Computer Utilisation. Dyba et al. [8] extend Riemenschneider et al.’s [9] work by ', 'incorporating measures of organisational support. The model derives its theoretical ', 'foundations by combining prior research in technology acceptance [11, 12, 17] with ', 'aspects of innovation diffusion theory [16] as well as empirically-tested research on ', 'software developers’ acceptance of methodologies [9]. The model contains five con¬ ', 'structs: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived compatibility, subjective ', 'norms and organisational support. ', '', 'Perceived usefulness is defined as the degree to which a person believes that using a ', 'particular system will enhance his or her job performance [9], which is similar to ', 'Rogers’ [16] perceived relative advantage [15]. Software developers generally receive ', 'reinforcements for good performance through raises, promotions and bonuses. In this ', 'study, perceived usefulness with respect to Kanban implies that a user believes that there ', 'is a positive user-performance relationship. The existing research provides evidence that ', 'perceived usefulness affects behavioural intention and actual use [9, 11-13, 17]. This ', 'pattern has also been confirmed within the software engineering domain [9]. Perceived ', 'ease of use refers to the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system ', 'will be free of effort [9]. Riemenschneider et al. found that ease of use played an ', 'insignificant role in software developers’ acceptance of methodologies [9]. However, ', 'perceived ease of use recurs in several studies as a significant determinant of adoption ', 'behaviour [9, 12, 17, 19]. In this regard, compared to other Agile methods, Kanban is ', 'perceived to be easier to use and less complex. According to Rogers, perceived com¬ ', 'patibility refers to the degree to which an innovation is perceived as being consistent ', 'with the existing values, needs and past experience of potential adopters [16]. Rogers ', 'further proposes that compatibility positively relates to the diffusion of innovations [16], ', 'making it a significant factor in explaining software developers’ acceptance of ', 'methodologies [9, 30]. Thus, a positive perceived compatibility may lead to favourable ', 'attitudes toward Kanban use. Subjective norms represent the degree to which software ', 'developers believe that others who are important to them think that they should use ', 'Kanban. This factor implies that the perceived social pressure to perform the behaviour ', 'will influence a person’s intentions [3], and some studies indeed demonstrate its ', 'importance [9, 13, 17, 18]. Thus, there is reason to believe that peers may influence ', 'Kanban use. Research has also noted the importance of organisational support, the ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Insights into the Perceived Benefits of Kanban ', '', '', '159 ', '', '', 'degree to which change agents promote or support efforts, as a factor in explaining an ', 'innovation’s rate of adoption [14, 16, 29]. Studies therefore suggest that there is reason ', 'to believe that organisational support assists in Kanban use. ', '', '', '2.2 Survey Design and Data Collection ', '', 'Sampling and Population: For the study, we targeted a global population of Kanban ', 'practitioners, sending out the survey to a Kanban practitioners group on Linkedln, ', 'administered by LeanKanban Incorporated. The population includes approximately ', '2000 software industry practitioners using Lean and Kanban in their work. ', '', 'Prior to administration, we pre-tested the survey with three experts from the soft¬ ', 'ware industry and three researchers. On the basis of this feedback, we revised the ', 'statements to have clearer wordings. At the beginning of the survey, participants were ', 'provided information about the purpose of the research and its benefits as well as ', 'information about the researchers. After revision, the survey was launched and ', 'remained open for one and a half months, between 20 June and 20 July 2015. During ', 'that time, 148 responses were received. Two of these responses were discarded because ', 'the participants were not using Kanban. These omissions left us with a total of 146 ', 'responses, forming the data for analysis. The survey consisted of three sections: ', '', 'Demographics: This part captured information about the respondents in terms of their ', 'organisations, Kanban experience and type of training received. ', '', 'Factors affecting Kanban use: The factors affecting Kanban-use questions were based ', 'on previous studies [8,9], but adapted to the particular context of this study. All of the ', 'variables related to the model’s five factors were measured using a five-point ', 'Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Survey ', 'questions are provided in the Appendix. ', '', 'Benefits and challenges of using Kanban: Questions regarding Kanban benefits were ', 'formulated based on previous studies [1, 6]. A five-point Likert-type scale was used to ', 'ask the respondents to rate the significance of particular benefits to their organisations. ', 'Further, in open-ended questions, the respondents could explain the obtained benefits ', 'and challenges faced in Kanban use. ', '', 'The data analysis was conducted through descriptive statistics. Before the analysis, ', 'the reliability of the factor construct measurements were analysed with Cronbach’s alpha. ', '', '3 Results ', '', 'The collected data set included 146 responses: 92 were from North America, 22 from ', 'Europe, 4 from Australia, 1 from South Korea and 1 from Russia. 26 respondents did ', 'not specify their country.

Only 10 respondents ', 'had no formal training but gained familiarity with Kanban. Most respondents use ', 'Kanban on most or all organisation projects (68.8 %). 23.9 % have used it for a few ', 'projects, and only 8.2 % have used it on an experimental basis. ', '', 'We performed a reliability analysis to test the reliability of scale constructs [27] ', 'using Cronbach’s alpha, which measures the internal consistency of the factor mea¬ ', 'sured by different variables.

Respondents perceived ', 'Kanban as compatible with how they organised their individual and team work. ', 'Previous empirical studies have verified the importance of perceived compatibility in ', 'development methodologies [9, 13, 30]. The emphasis on teamwork in software ', 'development creates social pressure on individuals. Kanban software development ', 'teams emphasise collaborative work, which may bring about social pressure at the ', 'individual level. Therefore, practitioners are more likely to adopt Kanban when the ', 'subjective norms for use are strong. Some studies have found subjective norms to be ', 'significant [9, 20], while others found them to be insignificant [8, 13]. In this study, the ', 'participants’ responses were positive in regards to subjective norms. The respondents ', 'were also positive in their responses regarding organisational support. They noted ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '162 ', '', '', 'M.O. Ahmad et al. ', '', '', 'that their organisations provide necessary resources to support Kanban use, including ', 'training and written Kanban guidance documents. The literature shows that organisa¬ ', 'tional support, such as external training and consultation, plays an important role in the ', 'use of Agile methodologies [20]. Training brings fresh perspectives to software ', 'industry practitioners while enabling their use of Kanban. Studies suggest that training ', 'positively alfects individuals’ beliefs about the perceived compatibility of an innova¬ ', 'tion [20, 31]. Because methodology training is the key to successful implementation ', '[28], Kanban adoption is more likely to be successful with organisational support.

', '', '“Kanban provides a very large increase in the ability to identify and minimize impediments as ', 'well as allow the team to self-swarm and work to bring resolution to potential trouble areas”. ', '', '“Benefits from Kanban include quicker identification of issues, bottlenecks, etc., of our pro¬ ', 'cesses, thus creating performance evaluation, control and continuous improvement opportu¬ ', 'nities for our development teams”. ', '', 'The third identified benefit of Kanban is that it helps to reduce WIP.

Respondents further explained as follows: ', '', '“Working on one story at a time reduces the stress”. ', '', '“Limiting work in progress makes it much easier for the team leaders to see what is happening ', 'in the team at any given moment in time. Before with a large amount of WIP, it was very hard to ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Insights into the Perceived Benefits of Kanban ', '', '', '163 ', '', '', 'keep track of who was working on what and how each of our feature groups were progressing. ', 'Also, limiting WIP and focusing on our oldest stories has helped us to dramatically control our ', 'cycle time”. ', '', 'When WIP limits are reduced, the teams work on smaller chunks that can be ', 'completed more easily, a finding also reported in previous studies [1, 3, 5, 6, 10]. ', 'A respondent expressed his or her team experience as follows: “[With Kanban, it is] ', 'easier to get smaller work items done. We had the problem that smaller items didn’t ', 'get worked on because the development team only concentrated on the larger products ', 'as directed by the product team. By splitting large work items up into smaller [pieces] ', 'we could get the smaller work items through as well ', '', 'Finally, Kanban helps to improve communication and collaboration inside the ', 'teams and with related stakeholders. The respondents explained that Kanban “ improves ', 'communication with the customers and other stakeholders, helps to collaborate and ', 'find solutions, improves the knowledge about the processes collecting data and using ', 'metrics”. The teams work collaboratively on tasks and find solutions for any imped¬ ', 'iments, which is a sign of team self-organisation. ', '', '', '3.2 Challenges in Kanban Use ', '', 'In an open-ended question, respondents shared challenges in using Kanban in their ', 'organisation. These challenges are organised in three main categories. ', '', 'Lack of proper training and misunderstanding of Kanban is a major challenge ', 'in its use. Surprisingly, the respondents demonstrated positive attitudes towards ', 'organisational support variables in the adopted research model. This finding could be ', 'due to the fact that respondents mentioned that co-workers usually teach Kanban’s key ', 'concepts and ways of working within organisations. This mentoring process can ', 'transfer bad habits and misunderstandings of Kanban’s key concepts. One respondent ', 'explains, “It (Kanban) is mostly taught through peer reviews and co-workers. If a set of ', 'people have a bad habit, that habit is often duplicated by those they train”. ', '', 'Other respondents made these statements: ', '', '“Kanban is very often misinterpreted and seen only as having work items visualised and ', 'progressed through on a board”. ', '', '“The biggest challenge I face is the lack of knowledge and understanding about what Kanban ', 'really is and the technical aspects of how to do it. Many people think they know but they really ', 'don’t know anything about it. So demystifying it for them has been an on-going and challenging ', 'issue”. Interestingly, similar challenges have been reported in earlier studies [1, 5, 6, 25]. ', '', 'Organisational culture and mind set is the second major challenge mentioned by ', 'respondents. They noted that management is quite busy and fails to devote attention to ', 'improving work processes. Further, there is mind-set challenge because managers ', 'prefer to use traditional methods, resisting the new way of working. Similar to other ', 'Agile methods, Kanban faces challenges in organisational culture and people’s ', 'mind-sets [1, 5, 6, 25]. Respondents mentioned the following: ', '', '“Time is not reserved for improving ways of working” “People and management are too busy ', 'to improve, resulting in not caring about process management methods. Some managers still ', 'prefer Microsoft projects and traditional methods ”. ', '', '', '164 ', '', '', 'M.O. Ahmad et al. ', '', '', 'Silos are created by top management and defended by middle management. Upper management ', 'seems hesitant to adopt Kanban ”. ', '', 'Many people are resistant to change; there is a lack of proper culture and management ', 'involvement and commitment”. ', '', 'Difficulties in Kanban implementation can be linked to a number of other ', 'challenges. For example, the respondents noted that there was a lack of proper planning ', 'before introducing Kanban to teams. With poor planning, the teams found it difficult to ', 'determine and respect WIP limits. They also found it challenging to work with remote ', 'offices and to see the big picture of work when broken down into smaller pieces. These ', 'challenges were expressed in these statements: ', '', '“ Work is broken down into smaller pieces, which make it more difficult to see the big picture ', '“After a period of time, we need to level set to get back on WIP limit awareness and Kanban ', 'board protocol. It is challenging to determine correct WIP limits. Stories are often so closely ', 'related that developers are conflicting with each other, resulting in difficult merges, ', 'etc. Developers have no power to change the process. When work is impeded, it’s unclear what ', 'the impeded developer is supposed to do. Kanban slows everything down for the sake of ', 'providing information ”. ', '', 'Again, earlier studies confirm these findings [1, 5, 6, 25, 28]. ', '', '4 Validity Threats ', '', 'In this study, we considered threats to validity throughout the research process by ', 'following the guidelines outlined by Runeson and Host [26]. With online surveys, there ', 'is always a risk that questions may be misunderstood. To reduce this risk, we pre-tested ', 'the survey with three experts from the software industry and three researchers. It is ', 'important to take in consideration that this study is not empirically validating the ', 'adopted model. There could be other factors which are affecting Kanban actual use. ', '', 'The survey was posted on Linkedln; there was no control for the researchers with ', 'respect to external validity (i.e., the general applicability of the results). What can be ', 'observed is that the respondents come from various sectors, such as software compa¬ ', 'nies, telecommunication services and hardware manufacturing companies. It is ', 'important to note that the study subjects were individuals who represented different ', 'organisations. Therefore, it would have been impossible for a single person to answer ', 'on behalf of the whole organisation. Additionally, respondents’ positions and roles ', 'vary within the organisations. Respondents in different organisational positions may ', 'have divergent views about the organisational practices and varying knowledge about ', 'Kanban, factors that could affect the reliability of the results to some degree. The ', 'respondents that opted to answer are more positive towards Kanban use; it may cause ', 'positive bias in the study. ', '', 'We intentionally selected the LeanKanban Linkedln community to obtain an ', 'appropriate data sample because the community has an understanding of Kanban and ', 'its use at work. Linkedln professional are considered groups to be a good source of data ', 'collection for researchers and practitioners from all seniority levels [32]. ', '', '', 'Insights into the Perceived Benefits of Kanban ', '', '', '165 ', '', '', '5 Conclusion and Future Work ', '', 'This research sought to explore the factors that practitioners consider to be important in ', 'the use of Kanban. It also investigated participants’ perceived Kanban benefits and ', 'challenges. The study indicates that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, per¬ ', 'ceived compatibility, subjective norms and organisational support can play important ', 'roles in Kanban use. Kanban practitioners find it easy to learn and use in their indi¬ ', 'vidual and team work. They also believe that Kanban is compatible with their work and ', 'useful in terms of improving job performance, productivity and quality. ', '', 'In general, it is important for managers to monitor and evaluate innovation factors, ', 'such as perceived usefulness and perceived compatibility. Such monitoring will help to ', 'sustain elfective Kanban use while enabling recognition of any need for change. Higher ', 'management support remains vital to Kanban initiatives in order to sustain visible ', 'benefits throughout the organisation. ', '', 'The results show three primary benefits of using Kanban: improved visibility of ', 'work, stronger development flow and reduced WIP. The respondents expressed that ', 'starting to use Kanban at work is not a straightforward process; rather, it requires ', 'convincing managers, developers and trainers. Kanban practitioners also reported three ', 'main challenges in Kanban use: organisational culture and mind set; lack of training ', 'and misunderstanding of Kanban; and difficulties in Kanban implementation. ', '', 'In the future, similar studies are needed in different regions and countries. Such ', 'studies would enable comparison of the latest trends in Kanban use and adoption ', 'around the globe. Additionally, future qualitative studies should focus explicitly on ', 'issues and problems. ', '', 'Acknowledgments.

The paper is summarized in Sect. 6 ', 'outlining the future research. ', '', '2 Literature Review ', '', '2.1 Challenges in Software Startups ', '', 'As Bosch et al. [4] point out, in order to understand the many challenges that ', 'software startups face, there is need to understand what a software startup is. An ', 'increasingly accepted definition of startup is from Ries [7], a human institution ', 'designed to deliver a new product or service under the conditions of extreme ', 'uncertainty. This definition highlights the characteristic of no or limited his¬ ', 'tory that a software startup has [3], and the chaotic environment it operates ', 'in. However, the definition does not emphasize the intention of a startup to ', 'find a scalable and sustainable business model [8] , which is a key distinguishing ', 'characteristic from established small businesses. ', '', 'There are few studies that investigate the challenges faced by software star¬ ', 'tups in SE research field [9,10], due to the nascent nature of software startup as ', '', '', 'Key Challenges in Software Startups Across Life Cycle Stages 171 ', '', '', 'a research area. One study that touches upon the challenges in early-stage star¬ ', 'tups is Bosch et al. [4]. One of the two research questions the study explores is ', 'what are the typical challenges when finding a product idea worth scaling. They ', 'conducted qualitative interviews with the practitioners in nine startup compa¬ ', 'nies. The interviewees confirm that it is very difficult to know how to work in a ', 'straight forward manner in early stage startups, and that decision-making sup¬ ', 'port is limited. However no other challenges have been mentioned and the focus ', 'of the study itself is less on investigating the challenges and more on developing ', 'a methodology to support multiple product ideas being investigated in parallel. ', '', 'Another study is focused on the specific challenges software startups con¬ ', 'front with respect to user experience design, an increasingly important aspect of ', 'software engineering. Based on an interview study with eight startups on their ', 'approaches to user experience work, Hokkanen and Vaananen-Vainio-Mattila [5] ', 'discover several user experience related challenges, including collecting mean¬ ', 'ingful information from users or customers, applying right method for collecting ', 'user feedback, and approaching right set of users. ', '', 'Our previous study [6] investigated the key challenges faced by software star¬ ', 'tups at early stages. By “early stage” we mean “from idea conceptualization ', 'to first time to market”. Based on a survey study, a list of top 10 challenges ', 'were identified: thriving in technology uncertainty, acquiring first paying cus¬ ', 'tomers, acquiring initial funding, building entrepreneurial team, delivering cus¬ ', 'tomer value, managing multiple tasks, defining minimum viable product, target¬ ', 'ing a niche market, staying focused and disciplined, and reaching the break-even ', 'point. These challenges are further classified into product, market, finance and ', 'team categories. A case study of two software startups is also presented in the ', 'paper, to provide a richer understanding than that allowed by a ranking list ', 'only. Since the focus of the study is limited to early stage software startups, a ', 'complete picture of the challenges faced by software startups at different stages ', 'is missing. The study presented in this paper is a continuation of [6] and intends ', 'to fill the observed knowledge gap. ', '', '', '2.2 Startup Life Cycle Stages ', '', 'Learning is a crucial aspect and element for any startup, as emphasized by the ', 'Lean Startup methodology [7]. According to Ries [7], startups do not exist to ', '“make stuff”. They exist to “learn how to build a sustainable business”. The ', 'process of learning can be divided into four stages in accordance to the customer ', 'development process [8] : defining or observing a problem; evaluating the problem; ', 'defining a solution; and evaluating the solution. It is worth emphasizing that ', 'the learning stages are not linear. Startups need to go through multiple build- ', 'measure-learn loops to find their sustainable business models. ', '', 'On the other hand, a startup goes through a product development process ', 'in parallel [8], which can be further divided into the following stages: concept, ', 'in development, working prototype, functional product with limited users, func¬ ', 'tional product with high growth, and mature product. While the learning process ', 'is engaged in customer-centric activities mainly happening outside the building, ', '', '', '172 X. Wang et al. ', '', '', 'product development is focused on the product-centric activities that are taking ', 'place internally. As contended by Blank [8], for a startup to succeed, the two ', 'processes must remain synchronized and operate in concert. ', '', 'In this study, we adopt both learning and product development stages as the ', 'perspectives on the life cycle of a software startup, and use them to systemati¬ ', 'cally analyse the perceived challenges. ', '', '3 Research Approach ', '', 'This study is based on a large survey that was employed to explore different ', 'aspects of software startups. For the purpose of this study, we only used a subset ', 'of the questions in the whole survey. These questions are composed of three parts. ', 'In the first part, the respondents were asked to provide background information ', 'about their startups, including the principal business domains, the countries ', 'they work in, and their roles within their startups. The second part is composed ', 'of the questions related to the learning stages and product development stages. ', 'Each question should be answered with a single choice from a set of predefined ', 'options as described in Sect. 2.2. In the third part, the participants were asked to ', 'provide three most significant challenges they perceived recently when working ', 'on their startups, ranked as biggest, second biggest and third biggest. Each ', 'question in this part should also be answered with a single choice from a set ', 'of predefined challenges. To obtain the set of challenges, various online forums ', 'related to entrepreneurship were searched. However, one open option was given ', 'when each challenge question was asked. If a respondent could not find a suitable ', 'option from the list, there was a possibility to specify a different challenge. The ', 'list of survey questions relevant to this study can be found in Appendix A. ', '', 'In total 8240 responses were received. We went through a more strict data ', 'cleaning process than that employed in our previous study [6] in order to ensure ', 'the quality of the data to be used in the analysis phase. First of all, we filtered ', 'out the responses that missed the values in the fields related to learning stage, ', 'product development stage and perceived biggest challenge. The data in these ', 'fields are mandatory for us to conduct further analysis. Since the unit of analysis ', 'is software startup company, we removed the data points which either did not ', 'provide startup names or entered suspicious names, such as “balh”, “ABC”, ', '“name”, etc. Secondly, we identified the companies that have multiple responses ', 'in the survey, and kept the response from the most senior role of the company ', 'based on the assumption that he/she would have a more holistic view of the ', 'company. If the roles of the respondents were not provided, we took the last ', 'entered entry from the same company. To further clean the data, we removed ', 'the responses which did not confirm that the startups in question were still in ', 'operation at the time the survey was answered, since the challenges were about ', 'those “recently” faced by the startups. If a startup was no more in operation, ', 'the answer about the challenges may not be as recent as requested. Last but ', 'not least, we removed what we considered “outlier” responses and data points ', 'showing some abnormal patterns. As a result, the total sample size was reduced ', 'to 4100. ', '', '', 'Key Challenges in Software Startups Across Life Cycle Stages 173 ', '', '', 'To answer the research question, what are the key challenges faced by soft¬ ', 'ware startups at different learning stages and product development stages, we ', 'examined the frequency at which each challenge was perceived by the respon¬ ', 'dents based on the learning stages and product development stages their startups ', 'are at.

The little variance between the two lists can be ', 'explained by the fact that the sample used in this study, even though including ', 'all stages of software startups, is skewed towards early stage startups. Table 1 ', 'shows that the majority of the startups in the sample are at early stages (at the ', 'first four stages of product development). ', '', 'Our study results demonstrate that building product is the biggest challenge ', 'faced by software startups at all stages, not just those at an early stage as shown ', 'in [6]. Along the same line of argument in [6], this finding is consistent with ', 'the generally innovative nature of software startups who are often chasing new ', 'technological changes and disrupting the software industry. Therefore they need ', 'to deal with cutting edge technology and apply innovative tools and techniques, ', 'which renders product development challenging endeavours. ', '', 'With an extremely small p-value (<0.0001), the hypotheses HI and H2 are ', 'supported, which means that what are perceived as the biggest challenges by ', 'software startups do vary across different learning as well as product develop¬ ', 'ment stages. Even though it is difficult to declare a global change pattern based ', 'on Figs. 2 and 3, it is noticeable that the significance of product and finance ', 'related challenges, such as building the product , minimum viable product and ', 'funding , decreases when learning and product development progress. In compar¬ ', 'ison, market related challenges such as customer acquisition and scaling become ', 'increasingly perceivable. This is hardly surprising since the main focuses and ', 'tasks of startups shift along their life cycles, so do the concerns and challenges ', 'entrepreneurial teams have to tackle. The picture is less clear when people and ', 'team related challenges are concerned, including building the team and stay focus ', '', '6 disciplined. There is no detectable overall tendency. This is somehow contra¬ ', 'dictory to our expectation that the more advanced startups are, the more stable ', 'and better jelled entrepreneurial teams are, and therefore the less people and ', 'team related challenges are perceived. ', '', '1 The names of the challenges reported in [6] were the adapted versions of the ones ', 'reported in this paper.

', '', 'The survey data provides a snapshot of the challenges faced by different ', 'software startups at different stages. A longitudinal study of different challenges ', 'faced by same companies at different stages would validate the findings from this ', 'study and provide richer contextual understanding of these challenges. It is also ', 'interesting to understand the uniqueness of the software startup challenges and ', 'their significance in comparison to other types of startups or new product devel¬ ', 'opment endeavours in general. Further more, future studies can investigate the ', 'potential linkage between the misalignment of learning and product development ', 'stages and startup failure. ', '', 'Open Access.

Boekhout ', '', '', 'The experiment involved two teams within the company: a junior team (let’s call ', 'them team Red), and a less junior team of developers (team Yellow). The junior team, ', 'the Reds, consisted entirely of young programmers with no previous work experience ', 'as developers. There was no senior developer available to guide them, and we needed ', 'some way to accelerate their learning process. The Yellow team was also very junior ', 'but had some programming experience, some from working at another company. ', '', 'This isn’t a group who by themselves who would scout the outer limits of IT ', 'innovation, so I didn’t expect them to be eager to try Mob Programming out. The ', 'reception was not even lukewarm; I would have to earn my pay to get this accepted. ', '', '3 Introduction of Mob Programming to Teams ', '', 'I started out by showing Woody Zuill’s video ‘A Day of Mob Programming’ [4] to the ', 'whole group. I explained that even I, a non-developer, had had a lot of fun participating ', 'in a session of Llewellyn Falco and that I would like to try it with the teams. ', '', 'I told them I thought it would be fun, and mentioned similarities I saw with some of ', 'the online games that I knew the junior team members liked playing in their own time. ', 'These games are high paced shoot-’m-ups, in which they acted as a team with a lot of ', 'online communication, and I hoped the similarities would spark an interest. ', '', 'A second argument was, via feedback in the retrospectives the teams had raised, ', 'that there was lot of difference in the skill level and use of tools between the team ', 'members, regardless of seniority and time with the company. Everyone agreed that it ', 'would be in the interest of the teams, the individuals and the company to spread those ', 'skills more evenly. I emphasized how Mob Programming could help us achieve this. ', '', 'Still, the first reactions were lukewarm. Even while stressing that the goal was ', 'learning and not delivery, people were complaining about the apparent lack of effi¬ ', 'ciency. A senior colleague, who was not part of these teams but influential in the ', 'company, openly said he would dislike working on a daily basis as was shown in the ', 'video. I stressed that if people liked this way of working we could do it more often, but ', 'that it was not my goal to make this the new default way of working in the office. In the ', 'end, I decided to just try. ', '', '4 Experiments ', '', 'As part of the series of Mob Programming sessions, we continuously adapted our way ', 'of working. When you’re doing hourly retrospectives, the rate of change can be very ', 'high. In the following Sect. 1 describe some of the larger, and more important, changes ', 'that happened, and the process we ended up with. ', '', '', '4.1 Room Setup ', '', 'We went through a few iterations before we arrived at a room setup that worked for us. ', 'Starting by just using the big screen we use for giving demo’s in the main team room, ', '', '', 'Mob Programming: Find Fun Faster 187 ', '', '', 'we quickly found that the screen was too small, and it was hard to get everyone a ', 'position near enough to it, due to all the desks. Distractions were also an issue, with ', 'many interruptions from outside the team, and simply from people’s workstations (see ', 'Fig. 1). ', '', '', '', 'Fig. 1. First try: mobbing in ', 'the team room ', '', '', 'Fig. 2. Second attempt: training Fig. 3. The final setup: ', 'room in conference-inspired comfort and proper lighting ', 'setting ', '', '', 'At the company we have a room designed for training. In this room we were ', 'somewhat more isolated from interruptions. The room has a projector and a big monitor ', 'for presentations. We quickly discovered that the resolution of the projector was too ', 'low and not clear enough. A good high resolution projector is the most optimal ', 'solution. We had to use the big monitor. ', '', 'The setup in the training room initially resembled the setup used in the XP2015 ', 'conference setting that I participated in. We rearranged the tables to create one central ', 'table, directly in front of the monitor, with a keyboard, mouse and one laptop. We ', 'arranged some chairs in a semicircle around that driver position, and simply switched ', 'places (see Fig. 2). ', '', 'We still found issues with this setup. The simple chairs, though good enough for a ', 'short mobbing session at a conference, wouldn’t do for sitting on all day. So we ', 'decided to use proper office chairs, and have everybody move around keeping their ', 'chair to save time and avoid continuously fiddling with the chair configuration (see ', 'Fig. 3). ', '', 'Lighting also turned out to be important; if there’s too much, it makes it hard to ', 'read the screen. But when it’s too dark the bright screen strains the eyes too much. By ', 'switching to a side-wall for the screen we could alleviate that particular issue. ', '', '', '4.2 Cycle Time ', '', 'Copying Woody’s video, we started with a rotation of 10 min. Unfortunately, it seemed ', 'that every change of driver and navigator became an interruption and it took the team ', 'time to get back in focus on the problem at hand. There was clearly no sign of flow. ', '', 'A tip I got from Llewellyn Franco at Agile 2015 [1] proved to be very important: ', 'lower the rotation cycle from 10 to 4 min. By rotating so quickly, the switch has to go ', 'smoothly, so that you really need to make sure the workspace is good, you have a good ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '188 ', '', '', 'K. Boekhout ', '', '', 'timer and most important, that everybody is fully involved all the time. After a while, ', 'Team Red slowed to 5 min, and declared this the sweet spot for them. ', '', '', '4.3 Structured Breaks ', '', 'Full involvement all the time can be exhausting. It’s worth noting that more mature ', 'teams might experience Mob Programming less stressing than Pair Programming, due ', 'to breaks in the rotation. However, in this situation the primary goal was not delivering ', 'software, but focus was on learning though training. ', '', 'So I made sure that every hour there was a 5-10 min break after the retrospective ', 'where people weren’t allowed to be behind the screen. Even then a full day can feel like ', 'a marathon. The biggest advantage of a full day, was that you can do a full Sprint and ', 'finish work in one day, which people found fulfilling. ', '', '', '4.4 A Sprint a Day Keeps the Coach Away ', '', 'I emphasized that the Mob Programming days were an experiment with the focus on ', 'learning, rather than delivering. Apparently I was a little bit too effective with the ', 'emphasis on learning and creating an environment of not delivering. ', '', 'The sessions were not always happening with the full attention of everyone in the ', 'team. The results were incomplete and would bleed over into additional work outside ', 'of the mob, and inside of the containing, normal sprint. Reflecting on this, we decided ', 'to put a little more focus on the mobbing day, and have a clear goal of taking a small ', 'story and having it deployed to production. I called this the ‘sprint in a day’, and it did ', 'put the whole process in a pressure cooker. ', '', 'The structure of that single-day-sprint was as follows: ', '', '• the team picks a user story during the planning session, taking into consideration ', 'that it had to be possible to finish the story in one day, ', '', '• the day starts with a tasking session, where the team does a breakdown of all the ', 'tasks needed to deliver the user story, ', '', '• then hourly cycles of development, which each ended in a retro and break, ', '', '• at the end of the day, the user story would be deployed to production ', '', '• the retro for the last hourly cycle is extended, looking back at the last hour and the ', 'whole day, ', '', '• the day is closed by making the retro report together as a mob, ', '', '• and we clean up the room before we leave. ', '', 'Giving ourselves this goal of completing the work had, perhaps predictably, an ', 'immediate effect. The first time the whole team stayed for an additional two and a half ', 'hours to deploy. Thus, they decided in the retro that perhaps more automation in the ', 'deployment process would not be a bad idea. It also raised awareness in the team about ', 'the advantages of small stories. ', '', '', '', 'Mob Programming: Find Fun Faster 189 ', '', '', '4.5 Hourly Retrospectives ', '', 'Already mentioned above, a core practice for our teams were the hourly retrospectives. ', 'With our focus on team learning, the most important outcome of the mob was in ', 'learning how to improve. ', '', 'An hourly retro needs to be short and to-the-point. We started with a simple ', 'positive/negative items system, and made sure this was visualized on our daily scrum ', 'board. Here’s an example of an early Task & Retro board (see Fig. 4): ', '', '', '', 'Fig. 4. An early task and retro board - notice the focus on the hourly retro ', '', 'The basis of the board is the horizontal axis for the hourly blocks. Every hour the ', 'corresponding column is used. The top part for positive feedback (e.g. “We chose a ', 'good user story to work on”), the lower part for the improvements (e.g. “tests fail”). ', '', 'The left of the board is a basic scrum (ToDo/In Progress/Done) board, turned on its ', 'side, where we kept track of the tasks for the day’s story. ', '', 'As we refined the retro, we changed the board from having distinct sections for ', 'positive and negative points to one where we have a gradual scale from top to bottom, ', 'inspired by the happiness metric [2]. ', '', 'In the example below (Fig. 5), note the trend towards negativity as the day pro¬ ', 'gresses, undoubtedly influenced by the lack of progress on the tasks shown in the task ', 'board on the left. ', '', 'In the next example (Fig. 6), a board from team Red, we do see a clear upward ', 'trend in day. The team has further extended the board by adding a task bum-up chart. ', '', '', '', 'Fig. 5.

Boekhout ', '', '', 'Retrospectives are also put in Confluence. Easier to read, for reference, and as this ', 'is done as a Mob at the end of the day, it is another moment where the retro points are ', 'digested by the team. Additionally, actions for the next session are added as tasks. ', '', '', '4.6 A Special Mob: Process Flow ', '', 'In one of our mobbing sessions it turned out that the story required the creation of a ', 'process flow. As no-one in the team had any experience in this area, this was a session ', 'where the coach (who used to be a process manager in a previous life) took on the role ', 'of navigator for the start of the session. It was interesting to see that, even though ', 'whiteboard drawings and Visio diagrams were the output instead of Java code, the ', 'same effects occurred as with other techniques: after a while our process manager could ', 'see that the basic skills had landed, and he could step back and let others take on the ', 'navigator role. ', '', '', '5 Acceptance ', '', 'Team Red, our junior team, embraced Mob Programming the most. They’ve indicated ', 'that they don’t want to work this way all week, because they had to do an individual ', 'study as well, and time spent in the mob meant less time to prepare for their OCA and ', 'OCP exams. But, even after the initial 8 sessions of our summer experiment, the team ', 'continues to have regular mobbing days. ', '', 'On the other hand, Team Yellow, the less junior team, disliked the experiment, ', 'didn’t like the working in a group, and kept saying that they thought it was inefficient, ', 'no matter how much I made clear that this wasn’t a consideration. So they stopped after ', 'only 3 attempts at mobbing. ', '', 'A few months after they had stopped, team Yellow needed to work in a new ', 'technical domain, with some pressure on learning this domain quickly due to a new ', 'project that they had landed. Team Yellow then decided to split in two groups, both ', 'addressing a particular area. Although they didn’t do the strict rotation, the interaction ', '(with driver/navigator roles, frequent updates in group and between the two groups) ', 'was clearly reminiscent of the setup they had experienced a few months earlier while ', 'mobbing. ', '', 'In an unexpected late update, only a few weeks before finalizing this paper team ', 'Yellow decided independently to Mob Program for a day to tackle a difficult user story. ', 'My initial conclusion that they had rejected the technique was premature: they did find ', 'value in mobbing and added this new tool to their toolbox. ', '', '', '6 Team Growth ', '', 'Learning software development is the primary goal for our group of junior developers. ', 'They were already delivering demos weekly, proving they understood the studied ', 'chapters in their books. Working in a mob with their peers accelerated everything, from ', 'exchanging coding practices to learning to have an opinion and to share or even defend it. ', '', '', '', 'Mob Programming: Find Fun Faster 191 ', '', '', 'For instance, one day Team Red discovered that the training room was not avail¬ ', 'able, so they decided to move to the boardroom. With unfavorable light conditions and ', 'table arrangement, they themselves decided the room as unfit and changed to a better ', 'room. All without any intervention of the coach, something that would be unthinkable a ', 'few weeks earlier. ', '', 'Team Red started to identify user stories that were suitable for Mob Programming ', 'and those which were not, in light of the very short cycle and strict rhythm. The ', 'characteristics of these stories proved to be mainly how clear the goal was and whether ', 'enough contextual information was available. Basically, they were finding shortcom¬ ', 'ings previously undetected in the Backlog. This dramatically improved the interactions ', 'with the Product Owner and within the team during the regular refinement sessions. ', '', 'Having to finish a story at the end of the day, the Yellow team noticed together that ', 'deployment to production took far too much time. Since they had the rule in place that ', 'everyone stayed until the day was closed with deploying the user story, it felt even ', 'longer. This drastically changed their attitude to deployment automation. ', '', 'A set of scripts had been disabled in Jenkins, because it gave too many errors. To ', 'speed up the deployment process the team had to re-enable the scripts and fix the ', 'problems. The process went down from 40 min to 10. ', '', 'With both teams lacking experience in Pair Programming, I made sure that the rules ', 'for Mob and Pair Programming were almost the same. So basically we do Mob Pro¬ ', 'gramming, but if the group consists of only two people we call it Pair Programming. ', 'Many people would perhaps dislike this approach, but after the experiment the result is ', 'that people more often choose to do Pair Programming than before. I am positive that ', 'with additional exposure they will reach a point where a more relaxed approach to ', 'pairing will also work for them. ', '', 'Overall, the level of discipline/cadence/structure went up for both teams, while at ', 'the same time the evaluations during the retrospectives were more positive and ', 'productive. ', '', 'The Red team is now very mature and self-sufficient in their day to day processes. ', 'Though they still need support on technical issues, they only need help from a scrum ', 'master when they run into conflicts or other situations that have a need for more life ', 'and work experience. ', '', '', '7 Conclusions ', '', 'I can state that because of these weekly Mob Programming days, the team as a whole ', 'and all its individuals have grown much faster than they could have done otherwise. ', 'Not only did they improve their coding skills, they improved in many other aspects, ', 'such as their requirements process, deployment procedures, appreciation for focus, and ', 'perhaps most important of all, their much higher degree of self-sufficiency. Learning ', 'would have been quicker and more directed with a senior as part of the team, but they ', 'progressed greatly, even on their own. ', '', 'As a coach, I had my own learning experience. The difference in reaction between ', 'the teams indicates that a different approach might be more effective with more senior ', 'people. Perhaps that is not surprising. We all get more set in our ways the longer we are ', '', '', '', '192 ', '', '', 'K. Boekhout ', '', '', 'used to our particular habits.

Despite being ', 'considered an “entertainment” product, our applications deal with an extremely ', 'sensitive subject for our customers: their money. With this in mind we dedicate ', 'a lot of time to the development of a strong quality process that gives us the ', 'confidence to release our products frequently. This process is in constant evolu¬ ', 'tion with the input from Delivery Managers and Developers but primarily from ', 'Quality Analysts. ', '', 'We work mainly with the most popular agile methodology Scrum, in mul¬ ', 'tidisciplinary teams of around 5-7 people, which includes the quality analysts ', '(usually one for each team/we don’t have a separate quality department). This ', 'integration of quality analysts into the teams means that different projects have ', 'different realities and in most cases, the project teams have the freedom to tailor ', 'their quality process according to their needs. For this reason, I will only refer to ', 'the quality process for the project that I have worked on, for the past 2,5 years, ', 'the Exchange desktop product that has 2 on-going projects: the Sports Site Web ', '(SSW), a Java-based (backend) desktop app, and the Exchange Desktop Site ', '(EDS), a newer (1,5 years), Angular-based desktop app. ', '', 'I will focus on three different subjects within our quality process - Mind ', 'mapping , Exploratory Testing and Continuous integration pipeline - and try to ', 'describe their evolution over the time I have been in the company. ', '', '2 Mind Mapping ', '', '2.1 Early Days and Old Process ', '', 'Back in 2013 when I joined Blip, mind maps were not a part of our quality ', 'process. As this was my first full time job as a Quality Analyst (in my previous ', 'job, testing was just a small part of my tasks), I started by learning the current ', 'process from other QA’s from the project. As we work in Scrum with two weeks ', 'sprints, the QA process is tightly connected with our Scrum process. ', '', 'As in most Scrum teams, the first interaction that a QA had with any user ', 'story was in the grooming ceremony. In this ceremony the Product owner ', 'explained the user stories in the backlog to the team. The QA, like any team ', 'member, tried to understand any possible flaws with the specification and make ', 'sure it was ready to be played. Before the team estimated the user story, it was ', 'common for the QA to discuss with the team a general idea of the strategy to ', 'test the user story, with special focus on the kind of automated regression tests ', 'that could be done. This helped the team estimate the user story with a bit more ', 'detail. This part of the process is still in use nowadays, as we feel it works well. ', '', 'In the beginning of a sprint the first goal of the QA was to define test cases ', '(this would happen before any real testing with the application). So for every ', 'user story the QA would do the following tasks: ', '', '1. Study the user story in more detail with special focus on its acceptance ', '', 'criteria, ', '', '', '', 'Agile Testing on an Online Betting Application 195 ', '', '', '2. Create test cases in our agile management tool (AMT) for all the scenarios ', 'that we would test manually as well as different input combinations for the ', 'scenarios to validate the acceptance criteria, and ', '', '3. Create test cases for all the scenarios that would be automated as regression ', 'tests. ', '', 'Applying this process to all the user stories would usually take at least the ', 'first couple of days of the sprint. After a user story was implemented, the QA ', 'would test it in a development environment following the test cases that had ', 'previously been defined, trying to find bugs. We understood later that doing so ', 'was quite restrictive, limiting our creativity and exploration. Our test activities ', 'mostly followed the “scripts”. ', '', '', '2.2 The Introduction of Mind Maps ', '', 'In late 2013, one of the more senior QA’s shared a new technique he had learned ', 'to help him explore the user stories and create a visual representation of our ', 'knowledge about a product feature, mind maps. This idea blew my mind com¬ ', 'pletely and I immediately started thinking how we could use this in our process. ', 'On the following sprint I started experimenting with this idea and created mind ', 'maps to help me in my testing strategy for every user story. The use of this ', 'technique had a huge and instantaneous impact in the way I worked. Since then, ', 'the way we use mind maps has gone through different stages. I will now explain ', 'what happened and what we learned along the way. ', '', '', '2.3 Mind Maps for Test Scenarios ', '', 'The very first thing I tried to do was to use the mind maps to replace step 2 of ', 'our process, which was the one I thought was the most inefficient. So instead of ', 'documenting every scenario that I was going to test with in different test cases ', 'in our AMT, I would create a mind map with all that information and attach ', 'that single mindmap to the user story. This was helpful at first because it was a ', 'much more visual way to represent that information than in separate test cases ', 'and it was more practical to use when I was testing the user story, executing ', 'those scenarios. Besides using the mind maps to guide me as I was testing the ', 'user story, I also started ticking off as complete the different scenarios and steps ', 'as I tested them in the app. I would later insert this updated mind map to the ', 'respective user story as a test result. This could be used as historical data to be ', 'consulted in the future if necessary. After some sprints following this method I ', 'realized that all this test result information was useless because nobody really ', 'needed it. Not me, not my delivery manager, not the other QA’s. So as a good ', 'Agile practitioner I stopped doing it because it wasn’t adding any value. I also ', 'stopped creating mind maps for test scenarios as I started observing that having ', 'all those predetermined test scenarios wasn’t really helping me find many bugs ', 'and was having the same impact in testing that step 2 previously had. ', '', '', '', '196 ', '', '', 'N. Gouveia ', '', '', '2.4 Mind Maps to Represent User Stories ', '', 'Around the time I was struggling with the route to pursue next with the mind ', 'maps, Michael Bolton came to Blip for the Rapid Software Testing workshop. ', 'We talked a lot about exploration, experimentation and learning. One technique ', 'exhaustively used during the workshop was precisely using mind maps to learn ', 'and explore the features and characteristics of a product. This inspired me to ', 'use mind maps in the same way, to learn more about the product instead of ', 'representing testing scenarios as I was doing before. ', '', 'I decided from that point on to try to represent the information on the ', 'user stories in a more structured way. Instead of mapping scenarios, I started ', 'mapping the different components of the module (or small section) that was ', 'being implemented and think about the different states that each component ', 'could have. Instead of replacing step 2 of the process, this new method helped ', 'me with the step 1 - learning as much as possible about the user story. Later, ', 'after the team had implemented the user story, I used the mind map that I had ', 'created to help me with my exploratory tests. At this point, and with the new ', 'concepts about exploration we had learned in the workshop, we (the QA’s on ', 'the project) decided to drop step 2 of our process, as we understood that it ', 'wasn’t adding value and didn’t really help us discover many bugs when we were ', 'testing. This meant that the only test cases that we defined in our AMT were ', 'those defined in step 3, the ones that would be automated as regression tests. ', '', '', '2.5 Repurposing Mind Maps - The Oracles Breakthrough ', '', 'Usually when implementing a new module, the work is divided into several user ', 'stories. Instead of creating one mind map for each user story, we started creating ', 'a single mind map for the entire module and updating it in every user story. ', 'These mind maps also included things common to the entire module like the ', 'visual specs or google analytics events that would be fired on specific actions. ', 'Figure 1 shows one our mind maps. ', '', 'This process was working fine, but I realized we had a problem: we were ', 'creating all these mind maps for every user story and modules and they were ', 'very useful while we were testing. But after that, they were stored in a folder ', 'and they were never used again. We understood that this was quite wasteful ', 'because we had so much valuable information being basically thrown away after ', 'the first utilization. ', '', '', 'Linking Everything. What I started doing was linking everything. At this ', 'point we had a mind map for each module but they were disconnected. So ', 'we created a “root” mind map that would reference all the different modules ', 'and pages we have in our application. Through this “root” mind map, anyone ', 'could access any mind map of any module in a few clicks. For some modules ', 'there were more levels of maps. In some cases we can have a module that has ', 'different implementations according to the sport we are in (e.g., market header ', 'for football, tennis, volleyball, etc.) and in those cases there will be a mind map ', '', '', 'Agile Testing on an Online Betting Application 197 ', '', '', 'Volleyball header specs.png 35 ', '', '', '', 'Fig. 1 . A simplified version of an actual mind map for the volleyball implementation ', 'of the Sports Header module ', '', '', 'for each of those implementations and one “super” mind map that links all of ', 'them together. For more complex modules, we may have the mind map of the ', 'module which has “sub” mind maps for different areas or sections of the module. ', '', 'This concept of linking mind maps really revolutionized the way we used ', 'this tool. Most importantly it helped us create something that was missing in ', 'our project: a high level vision of our product. Using this powerful tool, we ', 'centralized all the relevant information about our product that would otherwise ', 'be scattered all around our AMT. Mind maps started being used not just by ', 'testers but also by product owners, developers or any other person who wants to ', 'understand the expected behaviour of any module in our application. We would ', 'often see someone asking a question like: “Is this module supposed to appear ', 'in this page?” or “Do you remember the rules for this module we implemented ', 'a few months ago?” being answered two or three clicks after opening the root ', 'mind map. Now we can confidently say that this tool is in fact an Oracle for ', 'the behaviour of our application. ', '', '3 Exploratory Testing ', '', 'Exploratory testing in its essence has been used in Blip for many years, but it ', 'wasn’t always called that. Two and a half years ago, the term we used for the ', 'tests that were performed by the QA’s when a user story was implemented, was ', 'Manual Testing. Only later, around the same time we started using mind maps, ', 'we started using more consistently the term Exploratory testing, which is now ', 'completely rooted in our testing vocabulary. ', '', 'Exploratory testing at Blip has evolved a lot over the years. We made many ', 'improvements like introducing new testing techniques we learned or stopping ', 'specifying the test cases (for “manual” testing) beforehand, to allow us to explore ', 'and experiment with more freedom, without a predetermined script. Those were ', 'improvements but the aspect of exploratory testing that I want to talk about is ', 'not so much how we do it, but when we do it. ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '198 ', '', '', 'N. Gouveia ', '', '', '3.1 Testing After Cl Pipeline ', '', 'Back in 2013, the “exploratory” testing performed by the QA’s only happened ', 'when the code reached the alpha environment (with production data), which ', 'was the last step of our Cl pipeline. From the moment the developer submitted ', 'the code to the pipeline, it would take over one hour to reach this last stage, ', 'assuming everything went well (no errors on deployment or broken tests). This ', 'wouldn’t be a problem... except if the QA found one or more bugs! In those cases ', 'the cycle would go back to the beginning, and in the best scenario the QA would ', 'be able to test again, more than one hour later (assuming the developer would ', 'fix the bug immediately once it was communicated). This was an extremely large ', 'feedback cycle and had a huge impact in the amount of time it took to get a ', 'user story in front of the Product Owner, and so we decided to change that. ', '', '', '3.2 Setting the Local Environment ', '', 'Our strategy was to make sure that we as QA’s would have the same local ', 'environment that developers use to test their code. This way, when development ', 'is ready, we simply have to checkout the code from the remote repository and ', 'run it on our machines. We always have to make sure that this code is also ', 'updated with the latest version of the master branch, so that we don’t test the ', 'new user story on an outdated version of the site. ', '', 'This process allows us to have the user story in our hands faster as we don’t ', 'have to wait that it reaches the alpha environment. It also allows us to reduce ', 'drastically the time for the feedback cycle of any bug that is found - once we ', 'find it we can communicate it to developer and after he/she fixes it, we have it ', 'again in our hands seconds later. ', '', 'After the exploratory testing is finished, the code is then submitted to our ', 'Cl pipeline and once it reaches the alpha environment, we perform some sanity ', 'tests on the feature just to make sure everything is ok, and then we send it to ', 'our PO. ', '', 'This change we implemented may seem small, but it had a huge impact on ', 'the lead time of our user stories and allowed us to have them much earlier in ', 'front of our PO for approval. Feedback is an essential part of agile development, ', 'especially from the “client” (our PO in this case). The sooner it happens, the ', 'better. ', '', '4 Continuous Integration Pipeline ', '', 'Continuous Integration has been present at Blip for a long time now. ', '', 'Our Cl pipelines are a central piece of our quality process because they are ', 'the ones that allow us to continuously integrate our code while making sure that ', 'no regression has happened in our applications. ', '', 'Each project at Blip has its own Cl pipeline and as in other components of ', 'the quality process, it is normal that each project adopts its own strategy for ', 'that too. ', '', '', '', 'Agile Testing on an Online Betting Application 199 ', '', '', 'For the Exchange desktop product we have two ongoing projects, and there¬ ', 'fore two pipelines, one for the SSW project and other for the EDS project. In ', 'the SSW project we are currently only doing maintenance work, so the pipeline ', 'structure hasn’t changed in a long time, as well as the test suites that run in ', 'it. On the contrary, the EDS project is our currently most active project, which ', 'means that has a continuously improving pipeline, both from the regression test¬ ', 'ing suites and from the pipeline structure itself. For those reasons I will focus ', 'on describing the EDS pipeline. ', '', '', '4.1 EDS Pipeline Structure ', '', 'Figure 2 shows an example of a build in our pipeline.

', '', '1. The first step of our pipeline basically generates an RPM for that version ', 'of the code and runs our unit test suite against it. The unit tests suite is our ', 'largest test suite (over 2000 tests) for obvious reasons: it allows us to evaluate ', 'the correctness of each function in the code and with a very low execution ', 'time (under 16 s). Coverage can be a misleading metric, but we try to use it ', 'as a rule to have at least 80% branch coverage in our unit test suite. After ', 'this step the build is ready to be installed in any environment; ', '', '2. The second step is to deploy our build to our alpha test environment. ', 'This environment uses production data and can be used both for exploratory ', 'testing and automated regression testing. Once this step is completed, the ', 'following three steps start simultaneously. They are our UI test automation ', 'suites and run against the alpha test environment. They used to run sequen¬ ', 'tially, but now they run in parallel saving a lot of time, specially when all the ', 'tests pass. ', '', '3. The third step, executes our Smoke test suite. It runs tests with barely ', 'any interaction with the page aside from the assertions themselves (or expec¬ ', 'tations as we call it) which makes the tests quite fast. This suite is quite small ', 'representing roughly 10 % of our regression strategy. ', '', '4. The fourth step, runs the Mock test suite. These are simulation tests, ', 'where we control all the responses from the services, testing mainly two dif¬ ', 'ferent situations: the modules in isolation (testing all their components and ', 'their possible states) and more complex situations that generated or could ', '', '', '200 ', '', '', 'N. Gouveia ', '', '', 'generate critical defects. These are the most stable tests once they are not ', 'subject to possible service failures and we have total control over the data ', 'that is shown on the page. This suite represents around 60 % of our regression ', 'strategy. ', '', '5. The fifth step executes the End2End test suite. These tests represent ', 'more “real” scenarios that usually interact with several different modules of ', 'the application, not making use of any mocked data. These tests are great to ', 'test the integration between modules but are always held hostages of the data ', 'that is available in production. This suite represents the remaining 20 % of ', 'our regression strategy. ', '', '', '4.2 Current Challenges ', '', 'Our current pipeline is far from perfect, and we continuously work to try to ', 'improve it. Some of our biggest challenges are: ', '', '- Stability - This is our number one priority. Our tests aren’t as stable as ', 'we wished they were, and we have some flakiness at times. Our approach to ', 'improve this issue has been to tackle the most unstable tests first, disabling ', 'and fixing them. We are making some progress but we still have some tests ', '(the ones in worst shape) that show a failure rate of around 13 % which is not ', 'that good. ', '', '- Speed - The entire pipeline, from the first to the last step takes about 19 min. ', 'We are always concerned about this, because we don’t want our pipeline to ', 'become a delivery bottleneck for our User stories, and as we grow our codebase, ', 'the number of regression tests keeps increasing. Our latest improvements were ', 'to use as much parallelization as possible: our functional test suites (steps 3 ', 'to 5) run simultaneously as well as the suites themselves also parallelize their ', 'tests, using a selenium grid.

', '', 'Keywords: Agile software development • Development-maintenance ', 'transition • Scrum • Kanban • Case study ', '', '', '1 Introduction ', '', 'Kainos [1] is a public limited software company, established in 1986 and based in ', 'Belfast, Northern Ireland. It develops information technology solutions for businesses ', 'and organizations, particularly in the public, healthcare and financial services sectors. ', 'The company also provides consulting and support services. Kainos has offices in the ', 'UK, Ireland, Poland and the US, operating across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and ', 'North America. It has grown rapidly in recent years, with employee numbers of 260 in ', '2010, 350 in 2012, and now over 750 in 2015, of whom approximately 490 are engaged ', 'in development and 95 in service support (maintenance). ', '', 'Roughly, three-quarters of the work in the Service Support Department is concerned ', 'with software developed by the company. There are several major projects, however, ', 'where development took place elsewhere. In such cases, there is a significant challenge ', 'in taking on the software in a way that is relatively seamless for the client. The central ', 'concern is knowledge acquisition, with the goal being to build an understanding of ah ', 'aspects of the software without any adverse effect on the service provided in the tran¬ ', 'sition period. ', '', 'The paper focuses on the situation where a chent has had an agile way of working during ', 'development and wishes to work with Kainos using the same process during maintenance. ', 'The experience of a specific project with the UK Government Cabinet Office is described. ', 'This is preceded by background information on agile practices within Kainos.

', '', '', '2 Background ', '', 'The introduction of agile techniques at Kainos started with development. This began in ', 'the late 1990s with the introduction of DSDM, but has subsequently been overtaken by ', 'the use of Scrum. As noted in surveys carried out in 2010 and 2012 [2], the use of an ', 'agile approach in the company was mostly dictated by the requirements of each client. ', 'At that time, this did not include the public sector part of the business. Now, however, ', 'following a strong government commitment to agile practice in public projects [3], ', 'roughly 70 % of the work at Kainos is currently agile-based. ', '', 'The use of agile techniques in the Service Support Department is a relatively recent ', 'innovation, starting in 2013. Like software development, this has largely been client- ', 'led. Because of its significant involvement in the public sector, maintenance practices ', 'in the company are ITIL-based [4], with IS020000 IT Service Management accredita¬ ', 'tion [5] awarded in 2009. As a result, all aspects of the maintenance process are defined ', 'in detail, and audited for conformance annually. The process definition includes the role ', 'and content of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the provision of specific services, ', 'such as a Service Desk and the management of incidents and third-party suppliers. The ', 'transition process from development to maintenance is also specified and this will be ', 'considered further in the next section. Overall, the resulting process has proved very ', 'effective, for both Kainos and its clients. ', '', 'The Service Department at Kainos supports over 80 clients. Each client has an ', 'assigned service manager and an engineering team, the composition of which varies ', 'according to need. There is also a more senior group of service delivery managers who ', 'handle the commercial side of the work, including competition for contracts, contract ', 'agreement, and the pricing of new work as it emerges. ', '', 'Conceptually, the engineers form a single pool of staff, where often each engineer ', 'will work with several clients simultaneously. Because of this flexible structure, and a ', 'focus on responding quickly to client needs, agile techniques were first introduced ', 'through Kanban, supplemented with selected Scrum practices. The approach was based ', 'on the three key elements of Kanban identified in [6] : ', '', '• Visualize the workflow : using a Kanban board (whiteboard/wall), mark out columns ', 'showing the left to right stages in handling a client request/incident; split the work ', 'into pieces, write each item on a card and put it on the board. ', '', '• Limit work in progress (WIP): assign explicit limits on how many items may be in ', 'progress in each workflow column. ', '', '• Measure the lead/cycle time (average time to complete one item): optimize the ', 'process to make the lead time as small and predictable as possible. ', '', 'Each Kanban board was set up for the clients associated with a specific client ', 'manager. All boards started with the same base process but the associated engineers ', 'were encouraged to adjust them as they saw fit, in line with Kanban principles. As with ', 'any innovation, this worked best where a ‘champion’ emerged to lead the initiative. ', 'Where possible, daily stand-ups were used to review progress with client work and, ', 'initially, reflect on the effectiveness of the Kanban approach. ', '', '', 'Smoothing the Transition from Agile Software Development 211 ', '', '', 'As well as refining the structure of each Kanban board there was also a need to align ', 'its content with an existing Kainos Incident Management system (KIM), where clients ', 'report issues or make requests for change. KIM held all of the information associated ', 'with each work item. The Kanban cards simply recorded KIM references and brief ', 'summaries of the tasks involved. Aligning these parallel descriptions required discipline ', 'and, for most engineers, felt unsatisfactory. Another difficulty was that some engineers ', 'occasionally worked offsite, which meant they couldn’t see the board or keep it up-to- ', 'date with their own activity. To help address both problems an electronic Kanban system, ', 'KanbanFlow [7] was introduced in early 2014 and the physical boards replaced by elec¬ ', 'tronic screens. To retain most of the benefits of the original boards, each screen was ', 'dedicated to representing the board it replaced. Since then, the only change has been to ', 'switch from KanbanFlow to Trello [8], because of its adoption as the general agile ', 'support platform within Kainos. ', '', '3 The Transition Challenge ', '', 'Kainos has experience of all three types of software transition [9] : ', '', '• Self-to-self ,’ where the transition occurs entirely within the developing organization, ', 'continuing with the same process, and largely using the same personnel. ', '', '• Intra-organizational , where the system is passed from a development team to a ', 'separate maintenance team within the same organization. ', '', '• Inter-organizational , where the system is transferred to an entirely separate organi¬ ', 'zation. ', '', 'One significant example of self-to-self transition is Evolve [10], its electronic ', 'medical records system, which currently has 29 Healthcare Trust clients across 70 ', 'hospitals in the UK. As a major product, Evolve has a pool of dedicated staff responsible ', 'for its promotion, deployment and support. This includes: (i) a client-facing analysis ', 'team who work with each new Trust to identify its specific requirements; (ii) a back¬ ', 'end technical team who handle the implementation and deployment of each instance of ', 'Evolve, together with the ongoing enhancement of the base product; and (iii) a support ', 'team with the maintenance role of responding to client incidents and their requests for ', 'change. All of this work is managed using Scrum. ', '', 'Roughly 75 % of the projects at Kainos are intra-organizational, involving the ', 'transfer of responsibility for systems developed by a Kainos team to its Service Support ', 'Department. In some cases, client contracts allow for one or more years of maintenance ', 'support on top of initial development. More commonly, however, the company has to ', 'win a competitive tendering process to obtain such work. ', '', 'The remaining 25 % of projects at Kainos are inter-organizational, either in receiving ', 'systems developed in other organizations or in passing on systems that it has created. ', 'Such arrangements often reflect the preferences of individual clients. For example, some ', 'organizations, such as the UK Government, generally develop in-house and then ', '', '', '212 ', '', '', 'S. McCalden et al. ', '', '', 'contract out support responsibility for the resulting systems. Similarly, there are organ¬ ', 'izations that commission the initial development of systems with the intention of taking ', 'responsibility for them after deployment. ', '', 'When competing for projects, Kainos transition arrangements are made explicit, as ', 'part of the contract. These are defined around its ITIL-based support service. In partic¬ ', 'ular, this involves the creation of a Support Handover document for each transition. The ', 'document is instantiated from a general template that identifies all of the information ', 'that has to be provided by the client. This ranges from basic contact details, through ', 'descriptions of the software and associated tools, to a summary of known issues. Check¬ ', 'lists are used to ensure that no relevant information is overlooked. ', '', 'The many activities associated with transition in Kainos fall into three areas: ', '', '• Software transition , covering the transfer of all software-related artefacts from the ', 'development team to the maintenance team, including documentation, test suites, ', 'and product backlog, in addition to the software itself. ', '', '• Process transition , covering the introduction of the way in which the client and ', 'maintenance organization will interact. ', '', '• Knowledge transition , covering the acquisition of knowledge by the maintenance ', 'team to the level necessary to take over full responsibility for future changes. ', '', 'Each of these areas is discussed separately in the sub-sections that follow. ', '', 'Software Transition. With modern configuration management practices, Kainos find ', 'that software transition can usually be completed without difficulty. As well as gaining ', 'access to software-related assets, there is a need to examine wider environment arrange¬ ', 'ments. This involves reviewing: ', '', '• Assets and licenses , rationalizing if possible. ', '', '• Current infrastructure , to ensure appropriate environments are in place to resolve ', 'software issues and facilitate change; typically, this means ensuring that there are ', 'development, test and training environments in place, and that these are consistent ', 'with the live environment. ', '', '• Existing environments , to identify potential security issues, and make recommenda¬ ', 'tions for their resolution, as necessary. ', '', '• 3 rd party agreements , if any. ', '', 'Software transition is largely independent of agile practice, though with agile ', 'projects less documentation is expected and a more comprehensive test suite is likely to ', 'be in place. ', '', 'Process Transition. Process transition in Kainos involves the alignment of the working ', 'practices of the client with those of the company. This allows for adjustments on both ', 'sides to achieve a process that is efficient, effective and satisfactory to all, within the ', 'context of the contracted Service Level Agreement. The resulting process covers day- ', 'to-day interaction in managing incidents, and higher-level interaction associated with ', 'the planning, review and release of new content. This is also the time to introduce support ', 'technology, such as the use of an electronic help desk and/or incident management tools. ', '', '', '', 'Smoothing the Transition from Agile Software Development 213 ', '', '', 'Process transition is generally straightforward regardless of the practices on either ', 'side of the transition. Generally, the maintenance organization adapts to client require¬ ', 'ments, though small adjustments on the client side may be necessary. For example, ', 'clients accustomed to reporting issues at the end of a sprint cycle, will need to report ', 'them immediately in the maintenance phase. ', '', 'Knowledge Transition. The most difficult aspect of the development-maintenance ', 'transition is the acquisition of knowledge by the maintenance team. Training courses ', 'can help but there is really no substitute for hands-on experience, preferably with suitable ', 'members of the development team available to provide guidance. In Kainos, mainte¬ ', 'nance teams have found it useful to document their acquired knowledge in an Operations ', 'Manual, which is essentially a ‘how to’ guide for the system they are acquiring. ', '', 'It is important for clients to be aware of the difficulty of knowledge transfer and ', 'allow for it in their planning and costing of maintenance support. The options available ', 'are discussed in the next sub-section. ', '', 'Transition Strategy. The software, process and knowledge transition activities, ', 'discussed in the sub-sections above, identify what needs to be done during transition, ', 'but equally important are the decisions on where , how and by whom these are to be ', 'performed. Although, in principle, transition responsibilities could be shared between a ', 'development and maintenance team, the work is typically led by the maintenance team, ', 'as it is affected most by the success or otherwise of the process. ', '', 'One major factor influencing the efficiency and effectiveness of transition is the ', 'degree of overlap between development and maintenance. With self-to-self and intra- ', 'organizational transitions, both occurring within Kainos, there is flexibility in when and ', 'how transition is handled. For inter-organizational transitions, however, the process has ', 'to be treated formally. There are three situations to consider. The first is where there is ', 'no significant overlap between development and maintenance, implying an immediate ', 'transfer of system responsibly from one team to another. In such cases, knowledge tran¬ ', 'sition is more difficult, because typically there is little to no communication between the ', 'two teams involved, except through documentation. This is more of a problem for agile ', 'development projects where less documentation is produced. ', '', 'Where there is an overlap in transition between development and maintenance, there ', 'are two options available: ', '', '• Maintainer-site transition , where one or more of the development team works on¬ ', 'site with the maintenance team to facilitate transition activities, mostly in a coaching ', 'role. ', '', '• Developer-site transition , where one or more senior members of the maintenance ', 'team work on-site with the development team to complete all necessary transition ', 'activities; in doing so, the maintenance team members would be involved in produc¬ ', 'tion tasks, as an aid to knowledge transition. ', '', 'Maintainer-site transition has the advantage of occurring at a less pressured time, ', 'after deployment, but is typically less satisfactory overall. In particular, development ', '', '', '', '214 ', '', '', 'S. McCalden et al. ', '', '', 'team members have a weaker role, as they are not driving the transition; also, they are ', 'unlikely to be senior members of the team and so may lack a full understanding of all ', 'aspects of the system and its support. ', '', 'Developer-site transition can be a pressured situation if performed around a ‘go live’ ', 'date, which is often the case. A cyclical agile development structure is very helpful here, ', 'however, in that it allows the maintenance staff to join a project at the beginning of a ', 'sprint, and so be directly involved in its planning and subsequent review. Therefore, ', 'while developer-site transition is preferable to having no transition overlap at all, ', 'embedding maintenance staff in the development team appears to be the better option. ', 'This is the approach described in the next section in a project for the UK Government ', 'Cabinet Office. ', '', 'Transition Example. The UK Government Cabinet Office project is an example of an ', 'agile-oriented inter-organizational transition from development to maintenance. It is ', 'significant for Kainos in being its first and, so far, only example where a client wished ', 'to extend the sprint structure used in development, into maintenance. It is also the first ', 'project where the client facilitated transition by supporting service support staff working ', 'on-site with the development team. From an agile perspective, the system is additionally ', 'significant for the Government Digital Service (GDS) [11] who developed the system, ', 'in being their first example of a “major transactional service delivered all the way to ', 'live as an agile project ” [12]. ', '', 'The system, IER (Individual Electoral Registration), provides a single hub through ', 'which those eligible to vote in England, Scotland and Wales can register online. This ', 'covers 46 million people, across 387 local authorities. The service went live on 10 June ', '2014. The maintenance contract was awarded to Kainos in the same month, with the ', 'transition to maintenance occurring across July and August 2014. Thirty days of Kainos ', 'staff time were agreed to support the transition process. Two senior Kainos support ', 'engineers (normally based in Belfast) travelled separately to the developer site (in ', 'London) for part of each week; one engineer focused on web operations and the other ', 'on the remainder of the application (the first named author of this paper). The transition ', 'occurred after the ‘go live’ date, so developers were less pressured, although it did mean ', 'that fewer of them were available for consultation. ', '', 'A full schedule of activity was developed and approved ahead of the on-site transi¬ ', 'tion, indicating the work to be completed each day by each Kainos engineer. As part of ', 'their transition schedule, the Kainos engineers worked alongside their counterparts in ', 'GDS, assisting with the sprint backlog and working through incidents that occurred. ', '', '4 Lessons Learned ', '', 'The main lessons learned from the Cabinet Office transition project were: ', '', '• The timing and general structure of the transition felt close to optimal. Tackling the ', '', 'transition a month after the system went live meant that the development team were ', '', 'available to provide initial support in the crucial first few weeks of release, and then ', '', '', 'Smoothing the Transition from Agile Software Development 215 ', '', '', 'had time to support transition. There were 20 + lower priority items in the backlog ', 'at the go-live point, meaning that there were tasks available to facilitate knowledge ', 'transition and keep developers busy when there were no incidents to handle. ', '', '• Using developer-site transition proved very effective. With this approach, Service ', 'Support in Kainos was able to take on a substantial system, cover all incidents ', 'reported (there were very few) and move its development forward — all without any ', 'interruption in service. One significant achievement was taking responsibility for the ', 'system being rolled out to Scotland, which was delayed until after the independence ', 'referendum on 18 September 2014 [13]. ', '', '• Scheduling transition activities around an agile process is very straightforward. The ', 'cyclical nature of the work, and its detailed breakdown in a backlog, meant that it ', 'was relatively easy to identify tasks that could be shadowed, and others that could ', 'be tackled by the Kainos engineers to build up their experience. ', '', '• The GDS development team was very supportive of the transition process, making ', 'it fully effective. Greater efficiency may be possible, however, through a tighter ', 'collaboration. Specifically, this would involve inserting the transition tasks directly ', 'into the sprint backlog of the development team. In that way, transition activities ', 'would be covered in sprint planning meetings, daily standups, sprint reviews and ', 'sprint retrospectives, with a possibility of reducing the elapsed time of the transition ', 'and total effort expended. Further experimentation is needed to evaluate this possi¬ ', 'bility. ', '', '• The Cabinet Office requirement to run support with the same sprint structure as ', 'development was largely straightforward. The scale of the work involved meant that ', 'a support team could be dedicated to the contract, and work in Scrum cycles. The ', 'only difficulty encountered was a need to obtain approval for an exception to ISO ', '20000 certification to allow for changes to be specified as user stories rather than the ', 'usual, more detailed definitions.

To bring in real world experience they hired an ', 'external operational project manager and an external agile coach. ', '', 'More than one year later, the project is on a great track. The relationship between ', 'business and IT has reached new levels of trust. The rectorship and managers are very ', 'pleased with the project turn around. Enthusiasm, optimism, and fun, missing for so ', 'long, are back. Of course, not everything went smoothly. A lot of planned functionality ', 'is still missing. Some things still need to be improved. However, we are convinced that ', 'together we will succeed. In this experience report we would like to share with you what ', 'we learned. ', '', '2 Road to Perdition ', '', 'In this chapter we will describe the different phases of the first attempt at the SSP project ', 'from the beginning until the decision to restart in new a setup in April 2014. ', '', 'Phase 1 - “Ignorance is bliss” ', '', 'In 2012 the Federal Ministry of Science and Research approved the project. In 2013 the ', 'project started with an external company as general contractor. They sent a development ', 'team including an operational project manager. The collaboration between business and ', 'IT had been difficult. From IT’s point of view, business had inflated expectations on the ', 'features that were to be delivered while the contractor did not see what they had gotten ', 'into. At the same time, IT and business hoped to solve a lot of put off problems in the ', 'project. The moment the contractor realized that they tried to reduce project scope. ', '', 'Phase 2 - “Fear is the path to the dark side ', '', 'Even though the detailed scope was still being negotiated and the contractor’s analysts ', 'were still writing detailed specifications, the developers had to start. As a consequence ', 'the project was off to a very uncoordinated start. The process was like this: the analysts ', 'talked with business about the requirements, then went to the UI designers and devel¬ ', 'opers, and after that brought their feedback back to business. The requirement feedback ', 'loops were endless. At the end the contractor set deadlines for the approval of specifi¬ ', 'cations by business, even though they were not really finished. Project management tried ', 'to impose an ever more detailed process of deadlines and deliverables. While this was ', 'meant to clarify everyone’s responsibility it had the opposite effect - it lead to each party ', 'blaming the other. Everyone was driven by fear. ', '', '', 'George Lucas, Star Wars, Episode I: The Phantom Menace, 1999. ', '', '', 'i ', '', '', '', 'University of Vienna’s U:SPACE ', '', '', '219 ', '', '', 'Phase 3 - Acceptance Tests or “You shall not pass” 2 ', '', 'The team members’ good mood and motivation disappeared over these disputes. 9 ', 'months into project this development cumulated when the target date for the first release ', 'was not met because the acceptance test was not successful. It became clear that this ', 'mode of working did not yield any useful results. The release date was postponed twice. ', 'Yet the resulting software still could not be accepted by business. ', '', 'Phase 4 - “Nobody has any intention of building a wall” 3 ', '', 'At this point project goals did not matter anymore. The team members blamed each ', 'other for the failure to meet the release dates. As a consequence project management ', 'imposed more process and rules, documented in multi-page flow diagrams. By now no ', 'one even remotely believed the project could be turned around by a joint effort. ', '', 'Phase 5 - The War of Roses ', '', 'At that point in time, the whole project team stopped working on the product. Letters ', 'were sent back and forth between the rectorship and the contractor, trying to find a way ', 'out. There was none. From now on discussions moved to the legal level. 16 months into ', 'the project the partners agreed to cancel the contract. Overall, more than 1500 pages of ', 'specification and thousands of lines of codes were written. We spent hours in emergency ', 'meetings, the contractor changed their project managers 3 times. But none of the ', 'modules passed the acceptance tests. When the contract was terminated, none of our ', 'goals was achieved. ', '', 'Phase 6 - Returning to meaningful life ', '', 'Finally the last stage of grief began. Morale hit rock bottom. Both departments involved ', 'in the project met to lick their wounds. Lessons learned were identified and various ways ', 'were discussed how the project could be turned around. Many could not believe this was ', 'even possible. The following things were clear: IT and business had to find a way to ', 'work together more closely and take full responsibility for the project. No one ever ', 'wanted to depend on a single external contractor anymore. And finally: the restart should ', 'be agile. ', '', '3 The Restart: change2agile ', '', 'Two years earlier the IT department had invited some other business units to experiment ', 'with agile methods in a smaller project. The experiences with the SSP project reinforced ', 'those ideas, both in the project departments and the rectorship. So the IT department ', 'decided to switch all software development to Scrum. Before the SSP project could be ', 'restarted, the project team members had to prepare for the new agile process. ', '', '', 'J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring, 1954.

', '', '', '', '220 ', '', '', 'B. Pieber et al. ', '', '', 'What did we do when? ', '', 'After two restart workshops, one in the IT department, and another one together with ', 'the business units, an organizational development project was started in June 2014 - ', 'named change2agile (c2a). People of all relevant departments united and set up three ', 'cross-department teams to define the new agile working process. To gain practical ', 'experience in it we decided to run the change project as a Scrum project. As the IT ', 'department is also servicing other business units and they would be affected, we invited ', 'them to join the change process. ', '', 'What type of change stories did we have? ', '', 'As c2a was a change project the user stories were a little bit different to a normal user ', 'story. Here are some examples of our change stories: ', '', '- How should the teams be constituted, so that everyone is happy? ', '', '- How do we organize the release process? ', '', '- Define roles and responsibilities. ', '', '- What should be in a feature team’s user story? ', '', 'The change stories had acceptance criteria, e.g. “there exists documentation in the Wiki”, ', '“all relevant stakeholders have agreed”. In addition to the Wiki documentation a news¬ ', 'letter was sent to a wider group of stakeholders after each sprint. ', '', 'How did we organize? ', '', 'Each of the three Scrum teams included people from IT (software development, ', 'streaming department, operations and support) and business departments. Some of the ', 'line managers were part of the teams. However, they had no more rights than the other ', 'team members. There were two product owners, one from IT and one from the SSP ', 'business unit. Three members of IT volunteered to be Scrum Masters. Every team ', 'member was allowed to spend 20 % of her/his work time for the change project. The ', 'rest of the time people worked on their normal duties in their departments. ', '', 'Sprints were two weeks long in the beginning, later extended to three weeks. All the ', 'teams agreed on using JIRA for tracking c2a’s backlog. There was a weekly Scrum of ', 'Scrum. Planning meetings and reviews were held with all three teams together, retro¬ ', 'spectives were done in each team separately. The teams organized themselves, some ', 'met twice a week, some less regularly, depending on their change stories. The teams ', 'used planning poker to estimate story points in order to decide what stories could be ', 'done in the upcoming sprint. ', '', 'What worked well? ', '', 'The cross-department setup proved to be essential. Communication improved substan¬ ', 'tially. The time boxes helped focusing on the tasks to define how the projects should be ', 'run. It was a good vehicle for the IT and business units to get to know each other and to ', 'learn to collaborate. It increased self-confidence in our ability to really execute the switch ', 'to agile. It helped to reduce the fear of such a big organizational change. It allowed team ', 'members to experience the success they had lacked for so long. It helped avoid surprises. ', 'It helped to convince some of the sceptics. We had wanted to take our fate in our own ', 'hands and were finally allowed to do it. ', '', '', '', 'University of Vienna’s U:SPACE ', '', '', '221 ', '', '', 'Who/what helped? ', '', 'Line management helped by not interfering, encouraging self-organization and self¬ ', 'responsibility. All groups could participate in all decisions, e.g. the business team ', 'members on questions regarding software development. This was unheard of and helped ', 'building trust. It showed that transparency is a good thing. ', '', 'What did not work so well? ', '', 'Although all departments were invited some of them did not participate enough in the ', 'change process in hindsight. Some of the decisions stayed only theoretical and were ', 'never put into action, even although some of them would have been useful and were ', 'needed, e.g. the Definition of Done was not often followed. The Definition of Ready is ', 'still not used. Why? It was not possible to take care of every single aspect when the team ', 'started. It turned out to be difficult to put theory into practice immediately. It took some ', 'practice and retrospectives to finally get there. ', '', 'A small group of team members were fundamentally opposed to the agile process. ', 'They were sure that moving away from detailed analysis would lead to bad quality and ', 'chaos. This resulted in long and exhausting struggles and discussions. Which cost quite ', 'some energy. Two of them eventually decided to leave the university. ', '', 'What did we achieve? ', '', 'We successfully developed a clear common picture of how the agile process should be ', 'lived and practiced. This included a set of definitions and rules. Everything was docu¬ ', 'mented in a wiki. The change2agile team members spread this know-how in their ', 'respective units. Also, the change2agile team members decided to recruit external help ', 'for the SSP project: an operative project manager and an agile coach. In September 2014 ', 'they started working. ', '', 'On October 27th 2014 four Scrum cross-functional development teams officially ', 'started. They were built from members of the IT department’s groups project manage¬ ', 'ment, analysis & test, and software development. As a result every team consists of ', 'software developers, one to two analysts, one tester and one Scrum Master. The team ', 'members still report to their respective line managers. In the first step the group opera¬ ', 'tions & support was kept separate. This was a major milestone in the agile transforma¬ ', 'tion. From then on the SSP project had become a truly agile project. However, it was ', 'clear that this actually was just the beginning, the first step in a longer journey. ', '', '4 UrSPACE - The Agile Way to SSP ', '', 'With the most important questions on how to restart, we could begin the next step of the ', 'project leading to the release of the new portal, now named U:SPACE. ', '', 'How are we organized? ', '', 'Currently the IT department is running five Scrum development teams, two of which ', 'are assigned to the SSP project. In addition there are two external teams, one from a ', 'software development company and one from the Faculty of Computer Science. In total ', 'there are four SSP Scrum Teams. They work in sprints of three weeks starting with ', 'planning on Wednesday. The university uses a university management software package ', '', '', '', '222 ', '', '', 'B. Pieber et al. ', '', '', 'based on standard software with extensive customization. This system is the data ', 'backend for the new portal. Three freelancers, which are specialists for this system, are ', 'part of the IT Scrum teams. They are not based in Vienna but work from Germany. They ', 'fly in every three weeks for the refinement meetings. They participate in the other meet¬ ', 'ings using Skype. ', '', 'What is special? ', '', 'The SSP business unit decided to have 10+ product owners (PO) for four teams. The ', 'product owners are responsible for different topics and their respective stories. They ', 'meet once a week, in the PO board, and try as good as they can to reach an agreement ', 'about the user story priorities. In case of an unresolvable conflict the SSP business unit ', 'lead decides. This means that a team has more than one PO in a sprint. At the same time, ', 'one PO has stories for more than one team. This allows us to concentrate all teams on ', 'one bigger epic if needed. This means that POs and teams need to coordinate well to ', 'ensure all software parts fit together. ', '', 'To help coordinate between the POs themselves, the role backlog owner was intro¬ ', 'duced. One of the product owners fills this role. He is responsible for the JIRA backlog; ', 'he moderates the PO boards, but does not have more rights in prioritizing than the other ', 'product owners. ', '', 'How do we report? ', '', 'To bridge the gap to the non-agile departments a unique reporting process was initiated ', 'iteratively. The rectorship gets one report with the results from all four teams after every ', 'sprint, every three weeks. Project management assisted by the Scrum Masters and ', 'Product Owners writes it. It includes a calculation of the achieved business value. ', '', 'h* iutiflttt V*lut 2015 ', '', '70000 ', '', '', '', '.i pfloAjcto* ■ ■«f*>*e*s spnrM number ', '', '', 'Feedback is very positive. One vice rector expressed that now for the first time she ', 'has the feeling to really know the status of project, which gives her peace of mind. ', '', 'What did we deliver? ', '', 'In 2015 we put the first version of the portal online. A major new module for modelling ', 'the curricula was put into production. New versions of existing applications for students ', 'were introduced into the new portal, such as new records of examinations, study over¬ ', 'view, course directory. The process for admission to degree programs is now supported ', 'online the first time. Students have to visit the admission office less often, which was ', '', '', '', 'University of Vienna’s U:SPACE ', '', '', '223 ', '', '', 'one major goal of the SSP project. For university teachers a new application for grading ', 'exams was introduced. Feedback from them was generally positive. ', '', 'In December 2015 the rectorship decided to go with a recent high court ruling ', 'allowing universities to charge fees for entrance exams in the course of registration. The ', 'rector asked the teams if they could create the new function in U:SPACE. It had to be ', 'finished by March 1st, 2016. The teams took the challenge. Although it was hard work ', 'and time was running out in the end, the teams made it. The most critical success factor ', 'was the intense and very good collaboration within and between the teams. All this ', 'cumulated in a perfect review presentation. Agility at its best! ', '', 'What happened to change2agile? ', '', 'After the successful start of the Scrum teams many of the responsibilities of change2agile ', 'shifted to Scrum teams. However, the project members decided not to stop the project ', 'in order to address organizational issues concerning all teams. Some of the less important ', 'change stories had also not been finished. To account for the new responsibilities, some ', 'adaptations were made to the project. ', '', 'As the number of team members was reduced the project now consists of just one ', 'core team. The amount of time reserved for the change project was reduced significantly. ', 'The change2agile team is run as a governance team. The team members meet once a ', 'month. For each change story a volunteer assembles a smaller ad hoc team of experts ', 'to work on the change story. Because the people working on the change stories vary so ', 'much, Scrum turned out not to be ideal. Therefore the team members decided to switch ', 'to Kanban, which allows us to work on stories over a longer duration than a sprint’s ', 'length. ', '', 'Team Building and Human Factors ', '', 'As in any collaborative endeavor human factors play a major role. After the restart it ', 'took some time to build up trust again. Conflicts about various topics are unavoidable ', 'and pose valuable challenges for improving team collaboration. The agile coach is there ', 'to help the teams with these and other communication issues, by sharing his observa¬ ', 'tions, giving feedback, clarifying dynamics in the teams’ communication, and ', 'suggesting helpful models of communication psychology, such as Friedemann Schulz ', 'von Thun’s 4 four-side model of communication, value and development square, or ', 'Kerth’s retrospective prime directives. ', '', 'All team members and the management agree on the importance of the following ', 'values: open communication, business and IT working together on a daily basis, team ', 'autonomy and self-organization. The culture of retrospectives was established and ', 'improves transparency and honesty on all levels. In June 2015 all project team members ', 'met for a two-day team-building workshop. It was run as an Open Space and moderated ', 'by the external agile coach. It helped the participants to get to know each other better ', 'and discuss topics for which there had not been enough time in the day-to-day project ', 'work. Many of those topics led to change2agile backlog items. As feedback was positive ', 'management approved a repetition in 2016. Other regular team-building measures ', '', '', '4 ', '', '', 'Friedemann Schulz von Thun, Miteinander reden 1-4, 2010. ', '', '', '', '224 ', '', '', 'B. Pieber et al. ', '', '', 'organized by the Scrum Masters include sprint drinks, team days, release parties, visits ', 'to Vienna’s Christmas fair, and a solemn Christmas party. ', '', 'A Survey on the Agile Transformation ', '', 'Between July and October 2014 a survey was conducted among 17 members of four ', 'business units regarding their experience and satisfaction with the agile transformation ', 'on the one hand and the agile process on the other. The results show a median satisfaction ', 'of 7 out of 10 for the agile transformation and a median satisfaction of 8 out of 10 for ', 'the agile process at the time of the survey. ', '', 'Overall, we consider this a great result, with still some room for improvement. In ', 'one business unit the results were less positive, especially the satisfaction with the agile ', 'transformation. Not surprisingly, this was one of the business units, which did not ', 'participate much in change2agile. An important result of the survey was that some areas ', 'of improvement were identified. In the meantime many of them have already been dealt ', 'with, either by the respective Scrum teams or by the change2agile team. The head of the ', 'IT department together with his management team decided to repeat this type of survey ', 'at least once a year. ', '', 'Lessons Learned ', '', 'We learned that working together between departments is the basis for successfully ', 'achieving our goals. This is possible if everyone is respected as an individual with her/ ', 'his skills and shortcomings, which we found to be a prerequisite for trusting each other. ', 'Trust is essential within the project teams, and also to departments not fully involved in ', 'the agile process. One key factor is encouraging social contacts beyond the daily busi¬ ', 'ness. We learned that for taking on full responsibility for the project instead of solely ', 'relying on our external partner, we also need the management’s confidence. Regular ', 'delivery of software, regular, transparent reporting, and solving problems within the ', 'teams as much as possible are key factors. ', '', 'In order to achieve our change to agile working it is absolutely essential that our ', 'management is fully behind the agile values. They themselves engage in Management ', '3.0 theory and practice to better support the teams’ self-organization. We still have some ', 'problems with the fact that in the past there was a strict separation of roles (analysts, ', 'developers, and testers), which makes it difficult to work cross-functionally. ', '', 'Last but not least, we learned that to successfully introduce agile software develop¬ ', 'ment we also needed to develop our organizational structures and process in a funda¬ ', 'mental way. Using agile practices for doing that was essential to develop the right mind ', 'set. To everyone’s surprise, working in an agile way proofed to be entirely possible in ', 'such a huge, old, politically overloaded organization as an university. ', '', 'Acknowledgements.

So it is natural that people often ask me, “What exactly does an architect ', 'do in an agile environment?” (Often, when asking the question, they will emphasize the ', 'word exactly and accompany that emphasis with tone and gesture that express more skep¬ ', 'ticism than genuine curiosity). And the honest answer is that I do not know exactly what ', 'an architect does or should do, but I can tell them what I do, and by way of generalization, ', 'deduce what an architect does. ', '', '3 The Scary Problem ', '', 'Often people in the agile community will say something like, “The architecture is emer¬ ', 'gent.” They go on to say that we do not really need architects any more, as agile does ', 'not believe in upfront planning. This really has me quite challenged or even worried. ', 'I am an architect, I do architecture, and as such, I like to feel that I bring real value to ', 'the organization I work for. If the architecture is emergent and we don’t need an architect, ', 'then what does the architect do? How can the role of the architect be justified? ', '', 'Put a bit more formally the question can be formulated thus: Agile means responding ', 'to change. The Agile Manifesto item that most strongly represents the agile spirit is we ', 'value responding to change over following a plan. Looking up the word “agile” in a ', 'dictionary, I came across the definition, “able to move quickly and easily”. On the other ', 'hand, architecture is about long term planning; the architect has a long term vision of ', 'the domain and of the software system, and engages in technical planning. One of the ', 'definitions of architecture is “a unifying or coherent form or structure”. At first glance, ', 'long term planning and responding to change seem to be at odds with each other. Hence ', 'the question. Why do we need an architect in an agile environment? ', '', 'Historically, one of the drivers behind the agile movement was frustration with the ', 'architects. Architects design a system based on requirements. Developers implement a ', 'system as described by the specification. However, for many reasons requirements might ', 'not really carry the true intent of what the customer wants. Furthermore, the requirements ', 'even when clear and well understood, are in constant flux, and as a result architects are ', 'often in the business of predicting the future. Not only do we define what requirements ', 'the system needs to fulfill, but we also define what the future requirements are likely to ', 'be. In that environment, an architect makes decisions based on predictions, many of ', 'which are wrong to some extent or another. As Yogi Berra quipped, “It’s tough to make ', 'predictions, especially about the future.” If the predictions are wrong, then an imple¬ ', 'mentation based on the design stemming from those inaccurate (or just plain wrong) ', 'predictions will not meet the customer expectations. ', '', 'Frustrated with these wrong predictions, the agile community adopted the practice ', 'whereby all decision-making is deferred to a time of greater certainty. Now we can ', 'restate the question. If architecture is emergent, and it is difficult to say anything mean¬ ', 'ingful about the future, what is the role of the architect? It was this question that forced ', 'me to better define what exactly is architecture, and more importantly, what an architect ', 'does. I raised this question with many of my colleagues. All of them agreed that agile ', 'projects need architecture and architects. They differed on what exactly those architects ', 'and architectures are needed for, and quite a few of them were not able to clearly ', '', '', '', '228 A. Poupko ', '', '', 'articulate that need. But through the aggregation of all those answers, I was able to come ', 'up with some meaningful insights. ', '', '', '4 The Weekly Meeting ', '', 'About two years ago, I started a weekly meeting with other architects and technical ', 'leaders. Since many of us live and work in different countries, these meetings were often ', 'phone calls. We would hang around for an hour or so, and discuss the contributions we ', 'have made as architects, any interesting issues we faced that week, and what about our ', 'implementation of agile needs to be fixed. This turned out to be a great platform for ', 'discussion and idea sharing. I discovered that some architects are often great at retro¬ ', 'spection and introspection, and others are quite good at understanding people and how ', 'they interact with each other. Agile is about people more than it is about technology. So ', 'these insights on how people work turned out to be extremely valuable. ', '', 'One key insight that we kept returning to is that whether or not it is defined in the ', 'role of the architect, the agile architect deals with people, and a large part of the archi¬ ', 'tect’s role is a people role. For example, we were discussing the responsibility of the ', 'architect to communicate design decisions. We asked the question, to what extent should ', 'the architect feel obligated to convince the team of the wisdom of his decisions? We all ', 'agreed that not only must the architect explain the rationale behind his technical decision; ', 'he must convince the team of that rationale. Why? Because a team that understands and ', 'agrees with what they are doing, have a better chance of doing the right thing. If they ', 'identify with the work they are doing, they will do high quality work. ', '', '5 No Design Phase ', '', 'I think that part of the question regarding the role of an architect emerges when agile is ', 'compared to waterfall. In a waterfall environment, there is an explicit stage called the ', 'design phase. This phase is led by the architect. He designs and documents the solu¬ ', 'tions. The design is prescriptive. The assumption is that if the developers follow the ', 'design, then the software will be OK. This design phase is the most demanding and ', 'solemn of the entire software phase. If you get the design phase wrong, you will end up ', 'paying a high price for years to come. ', '', 'On the other hand, in an agile environment, there often is no design phase. In conse¬ ', 'quence, the reasoning often goes: “If in an agile environment, there is no design phase, ', 'so there is no designer hence no architect.” So we must clarify. No design phase does ', 'not mean “no design”. No design phase means that there is not an explicit phase during ', 'which design happens exclusively. Rather, design happens all the time. Likewise, ', 'when we say that the architecture is emergent, that should not mean that we do not need ', 'architects because architecture just happens. That is not true. It means something much ', 'more subtle. When we say that the architecture is emergent, we are saying that as the ', 'system evolves, a certain structure emerges. Someone needs to keep an eye on that ', 'emerging structure. When it is emerging according to plan, the architect will strengthen ', 'it, and when it is starts diverging, the architect will act accordingly. Maybe adjusting ', '', '', '', 'The Journey Continues: Discovering My Role as an Architect ', '', '', '229 ', '', '', 'the plan, or maybe pushing the development in a particular direction - or both. Person¬ ', 'ally, this was the most dramatic change for me as an architect when transitioning to an ', 'agile environment. The fact that I am designing all the time, and not just during the ', 'design phase, has a significant impact. ', '', 'So in my current role, I am always designing. The domain is changing, the require¬ ', 'ments are changing, and our understanding of the world is changing. Agile realizes and ', 'accommodates these changes. As a result, I am always designing. ', '', '', '5.1 Reservation ', '', 'I’ll be honest. Not because I have to, but because I choose to. Making a decision at the ', '“most responsible moment” is a great slogan. In reality it is somewhere between very ', 'hard and impossible. We often do not know what the most responsible moment is until ', 'that moment is long gone. That has often happened to me. I defer a decision to a later ', 'moment, because I feel that it would be irresponsible to decide now. At that later ', 'moment, I realize that I missed the opportune moment. This happens much more often ', 'than I care for. Every time it happens, I realize (once again) that my responsibility as an ', 'architect is not only to make and communicate technical decisions, but to make them at ', 'the right time. ', '', 'It is safe to say that as an architect I am always designing. I am always trying to find ', 'the right time to make design decisions, and I am often fixing mistakes when I missed ', 'the right time for a particular decision 1 . ', '', '6 Retrospection ', '', 'Looking inward, I notice more and more that most of what I do as an architect is to ', 'interact with people. As an architect, even when I write technical documents, I am ', 'dealing with people. When a developer writes code or script his primary audience is the ', 'compiler or interpreter. If he writes something that is clear and unambiguous, but is not ', 'clear to the compiler he has not delivered. His secondary audience are human beings. ', 'The developer writes clear code with useful names for classes and functions, he writes ', 'comments that are concise and do not contain too many lies. ', '', 'On the other hand, when the architect designs something, or creates an artifact ', 'of any sort (diagram interface and so forth), his primary audience is the human being ', 'reading that artifact. The architect is constantly learning and explaining. On further ', 'inspection, architecture itself is a very human thing. Structure or lack of structure are ', 'how humans perceive the system. This is captured beautifully by Christopher ', 'Alexander in the introduction to The Nature of Order. Order and symmetry are ', 'perceived by humans and used by humans. Even when humans cannot find formal ', '', '', 'For an insightful discussion of last possible moment as opposed to most possible moment see ', '', 'http://wirfs-brock.com/blog/2011/01/18/agile-architecture-myths-2-architecture-decisions- ', '', 'should-be-made-at-the-last-responsible-moment/. ', '', '', '', '230 A. Poupko ', '', '', 'words to express what it is they are feeling, they share a sense of orderliness that can ', 'be communicated through aesthetic design. ', '', '“The structure I identify as the foundation of all order is also personal. As we learn ', 'to understand it, we shall see that our own feeling, the feeling of what it is to be a person, ', 'rooted, happy, alive in oneself, straightforward and ordinary, is itself inextricably ', 'connected with order. This order is not remote from our humanity. It is the stuff which ', 'goes to the very heart of human experience”. ', '', 'Wow! Does that mean that when I, as an architect, deal with order, I am dealing with ', 'the stuff that “goes to the very heart of human experience”? That is way more than I ', 'bargained for when taking this job. ', '', '7 Domain Knowledge ', '', 'Even when the architecture is emergent, the domain certainly is not. The domain is the ', 'real world. It is the business need that the software is there to solve. The business needs ', 'and the rates of change of those business needs are not emergent. What might be emer¬ ', 'gent is the understanding of the domain, and the software structures that support that ', 'understanding. ', '', 'Domain understanding is critical for the success of the software. Good architecture ', 'will not emerge from software being developed, unless the developer of the software ', 'has a good understanding of the problem she is solving. ', '', 'Someone needs to understand the domain, and be capable of organizing that under¬ ', 'standing and explaining it, and then, by observing how that understanding is reflected ', 'in software, confirm that indeed the understanding was correct. And in cases where the ', 'understanding was not correct, that someone needs to fix things. ', '', 'That someone is the architect. ', '', '8 Dependencies ', '', 'One of the most complicated things that the architect deals with is dependencies. It is ', 'easy to state, “A is dependent on B”, as though dependency was a binary value that either ', 'exists or does not exist. In reality, it is the nature of the dependency that matters. The ', 'architect understands the dependencies between the domain elements (human and other¬ ', 'wise) as well as the dependency between the solution elements (human and otherwise). ', 'She is able to offer guidance based on her understanding of those dependencies. ', '', 'An example can illustrate this point. In one particular project, we recorded depend¬ ', 'encies in Rally. Each user story had a list of other user stories it was dependent on. Those ', 'user stories had to be implemented first before the current user story could be imple¬ ', 'mented. One time, after we put all the dependencies in place, we realized that we have ', 'a cycle or gridlock where A (Optimize Bandwidth Usage) was dependent on B ', '(Configure Channel), and B (Configure Channel) was dependent on A (Optimize Band¬ ', 'width Usage). That caused a few moments of panic until I pointed out that the depend¬ ', 'encies have different meanings. When A was dependent on B, we meant to say that we ', 'cannot implement A until we have a proper understanding of B, because B is the primary ', '', '', '', 'The Journey Continues: Discovering My Role as an Architect ', '', '', '231 ', '', '', 'client of A, and thus if we do not understand B we cannot implement A. On the other ', 'hand, when B was dependent on A, we did not mean to say that B is of zero value without ', 'A, all we meant to say was that B cannot provide its full business value without A. ', '', 'The nature of these dependencies were clear to me as an architect, and were quite ', 'clear to many on the team that understood the domain and the project. However, the ', 'graph of the features in Rally seemed to indicate a circular dependency. Once I pointed ', 'out the nature of the dependencies, the way forward was obvious, and we decoupled A’s ', 'implementation from A’s interface in a way that allowed development of B to progress. ', '', '9 Metaphors ', '', 'Rebecca Wirfs-Brock elaborates on the various types of architects (“Why we Need ', 'Architects and Architecture on Agile Projects” - Most recently presented at ILTam ', 'Conference 2015). I would like to propose some additional metaphors that describe the ', 'architect. These are not distinct. Rather in an agile world each architect has all of them. ', 'Personally, I have acted in all these roles, often in many of them simultaneously. ', '', '9.1 The Tribal Elder ', '', 'In this role, the architect acts as the guardian of the collective memory. He has seen the ', 'domain evolve and the architecture evolve. He understands why decisions were made. ', 'He understands the deeper meaning of the various dependencies. He is also very expe¬ ', 'rienced beyond the scope of the particular problem. He remembers mistakes that were ', 'made, and how they can be avoided. He remembers useful lessons. He has seen how ', 'many predictions that were made with certainty do not materialize, and he has seen many ', 'surprises. He has a wealth of stories that he is happy to share to make his point. He might ', 'not be as “hands on” or as quick on his feet as some of the younger ones, but he more ', 'than compensates for that with maturity, understanding of human nature and experience. ', '', 'One of the challenges with retrospectives and with lessons learned, is how do we ', 'preserve these insights over time? How do we maintain a record of these lessons? In a ', 'lean or agile environment, this tribal elder is constantly making sure that lessons that ', 'were painfully learned are not forgotten. ', '', 'The challenges for a tribal elder are many. Too often he expects that people will ', 'accept his word on authority alone, rather than on the merit of his idea. On occasion we ', 'might find that the tribal elder has lost touch with the times, as lessons learned a long ', 'time ago might not be relevant any more, and the tribe elder will try to keep us in line ', 'with dogmas that are no longer relevant. So this architect needs to be humble and to ', 'have a very good sense as to when his experience is of value, and when it is outdated. ', '', 'In my group, we are constantly caught up in the tension between a generic product ', 'and a customized product tailored to meet the customer. This tension has existed for ', 'over twenty years, and we periodically cycle from one extreme to another. Now, when ', 'someone suggests a shift from a generic product to a customized product or vice versa, ', 'the tribal elder (me) will tell stories of what worked and what failed in the past. The tribe ', 'elder will warn of pitfalls, while taking care not to dampen any enthusiasm. ', '', '', '', '232 A. Poupko ', '', '', '9.2 The Architect as the Human Document ', '', 'A document is a source of information and of agreement. If you need information consult ', 'the document. If you are in an argument, the document might be able to arbitrate. The ', 'architect can fulfil some of that need but even better. ', '', 'Sometimes code is referred to as the “Living Document” - meaning that the code is ', 'always up-to-date in communicating what the system does. (This is as opposed to a ', '“dead document” that at best was correct at some point in the past.) However, code will ', 'only tell you what the system does and how it does it. It will never tell you why the ', 'system does what it does, or what the system should be doing. ', '', 'The architect is able to actually explain all the relevant knowledge that is not captured ', 'in code. Relevance is a matter of context. Because the architect is contextually aware, ', 'he can give the information that is relevant in a particular context. ', '', 'There are several dangers that the architect as a human document must be aware of. ', 'First and foremost, the architect must not think that he can forgo clear, concise and ', 'accurate documents, just because he is smart and articulate. Good documents have the ', 'advantage of being unambiguous, context free, and they never change their minds. ', 'Interfaces must be documented. This is especially true for teams that work over long ', 'periods of time or across great geographical distances. ', '', 'In the role of the human document, the architect must take care not to become a ', 'bottleneck. If everyone is waiting in line to get the time and attention of the architect, ', 'then the work gets held up. It is the responsibility of the architect to ensure that does not ', 'happen. ', '', '9.3 The Architect as the Potter ', '', 'Looking at a potter working, you will notice that the interaction between the potter and ', 'the clay is very light and very accurate. The illusion is so strong that the clay might ', 'actually think that it is molding itself into a vase or bowl. The clay does not fully under¬ ', 'stand the role of the potter, and might see him as redundant. But that is not true. Without ', 'the potter’s continued presence and intervention, the clay will find itself all over the ', 'walls of the workshop. On the other hand, the potter needs to be gentle. If the potter is ', 'too aggressive, the clay will resist, and the result will be a shapeless mass. The “potter ', 'architect” does the same. He allows the architecture to emerge on its own, and only ', 'makes featherlight touches here and there when he sees that things need a little fixing. ', 'If he is really good, the people will say that the architecture is emergent. He might be ', 'so effective the team will start asking what they need him for. ', '', '10 Qualities ', '', 'As I mentioned in the opening of this paper, it is becoming apparent to me that the role ', 'of the architect in an agile environment has a great deal to do with people skills. In my ', 'own personal journey I am discovering that quite often I need to call on those skills in ', 'order to be an effective architect. ', '', '', '', 'The Journey Continues: Discovering My Role as an Architect ', '', '', '233 ', '', '', 'I would like to outline some traits that I find particularly useful. While these are good ', 'qualities in any person, they are critical for the architect. I am not including the standard ', 'qualities such as a quick understanding and good memory. I am focusing on social skills. ', '', 'Teacher at Heart - The architect must be able to explain complex material at the depth ', 'that is appropriate to the audience.

Metaphor, drama, humor, multisensory, example, tonality and so forth. ', '', 'Empathy - The architect must be able to see things from someone else’s perspective. ', 'That will allow the architect to understand the domain and to be able to explain the ', 'domain as well as the solution to people that have experiences other than his own. The ', 'empathetic architect understands that his perspective is not the only perspective, and ', 'that the underlying assumptions of the audience, are very different from his own. ', '', 'Sense of Humor - The architect must take himself seriously, but not too seriously. ', 'A sense of humor will allow the architect to see new and surprising angles on things. ', 'A sense of humor will allow the architect to break patterns in interesting ways and find ', 'a solution to an elusive problem. ', '', 'Humility - The architect holds power, authority, and a great deal of respect. His word ', 'is often the final word on technical matters. He often gets to set the technical direction ', 'of a product or a project. However he is not immune to mistakes, and his mistakes can ', 'often have far reaching consequences. Agile is about recognizing and admitting ', 'mistakes. An architect that sticks to a decision just because it was his decision will fail. ', 'The architect must be prepared to admit that he made an error in judgment, or was not ', 'diligent enough in his research. ', '', '11 Summary ', '', 'Agile is about responding to change. Architecture is about structure, uniformity and ', 'stability. The architect has a high awareness of how to balance the two. As the system ', 'undergoes change, the architect will understand and communicate what parts of the ', 'system need to stay the same and what parts should change. ', '', 'The architect is the bridge between the people and the technology. He not only ', 'understands what the software does and knows how to get there. He is deeply aware of ', 'the human aspect, and uses his human understanding to lead the project forward. ', '', 'Acknowledgements. The ideas in this article have been evolving over a long time.

', '', '2.2.2 Process ', '', 'Before developers could begin coding, they were required to write a design specification. ', 'This deliverable was not contractually bound and was only stipulated upon project ', 'commencement and yet all vendors agreed to adhere to this. In some cases, developers ', 'spent an entire sprint writing a specification and delivering nothing. What I found quite ', 'peculiar is that many people agreed that this was a good use of time even though sprint ', 'deliverables were not being met. ', '', '2.2.3 Change ', '', 'Change requests were frowned upon because they implied a change to the requirements. ', 'As mentioned, there was an assumption that the large cost of BDUF negated the need ', 'for any changes. As change requests arose, executives required that the vendors provide ', 'thorough documentation. Consequently, teams stopped working on their sprint goals as ', 'they context switched to accommodate the executives. In most cases, the change request ', 'was rejected and the vendors had to absorb the cost. ', '', '3 Lessons Learned Applied ', '', '3.1 Good Communication is Important ', '', 'Be Serious About the Standup: On subsequent projects I experienced many different ', 'interpretations of the daily standup. For some teams, the meeting turned into a 1 h water ', 'cooler discussion that included the weather and the sporting events from the previous ', 'night. Other teams used the time to problem solve. In some cases, my team members ', 'decided that the meeting was optional and decided to attend when it suited them or when ', 'they felt like it. On a more recent project, I stressed the importance of the standup meeting ', 'by explaining “why” it was important. Team members began to realize that it was in ', 'their best interest to understand what other team members were doing. At first, they ', 'struggled with the 15 min rule. However, I received a really good tip at an Agile confer¬ ', 'ence. The session speaker suggested that at the start of the meeting, the ScrumMaster ', '', '', 'Lessons Learned from a Failed Attempt at Distributed Agile 239 ', '', '', 'should set a 15 min timer on their smart phone. When 15 min expires, simply end the ', 'meeting. After 3 or 4 times, teams will get the hint and start adhering to the timebox. In ', 'fact, one of my teams introduced a post standup discussion. Immediately after the ', 'meeting, any team member was allowed to discuss anything they chose as long as it ', 'benefited everyone. This included anything from upcoming vacation schedules to the ', 'progress of testing. ', '', 'Aim for Totally Integrated: We live in a world were distributed teams are becoming ', 'the norm. According to Sutherland [5], there are three types of Scrum implementations ', 'when teams are distributed. Isolated scrums, where teams work completely independent ', 'of one another and have very little communication. In fact, some teams abandon Scrum ', 'and fall back to waterfall. Distributed scrum of scrums, where teams are mainly isolated ', 'but are integrated by a scrum of scrums that meet regularly. Totally integrated scrums, ', 'where teams are cross-functional [6] and the project is integrated as a whole. Overall, I ', 'would describe the failed project as the isolated scrums model. Not only did the teams ', 'work independently, they had very little knowledge of what the other teams were doing. ', 'Despite my best efforts, the totally integrated model was never reached on any project. ', 'However, having those aspirations allowed for the progression from isolated scrums to ', 'distributed scrums of scrums on more than one occasion. ', '', 'Collocate the ScrumMaster: On ensuing projects the distributed nature of the Scrum- ', 'Master greatly affected the team. There was little to no confidence in the ScrumMaster ', 'figurehead who was rarely seen and had very little involvement. Also, it seemed that on ', 'most projects it was assumed that the project manager should take on the role of Scrum¬ ', 'Master. Much more success was achieved when one of the team members (that was ', 'collocated) took on the role of ScrumMaster. On one project in particular, we decided ', 'to rotate the role amongst ourselves which made the experience much more enjoyable. ', 'Even though this approach worked much better, I’m not sure this would have been ', 'successful with a non-collocated team member facilitating the role of ScrumMaster. ', '', 'On another project we split the role of the ScrumMaster. Essentially, we had a team ', 'ScrumMaster who was collocated with the team. Additionally, we had a client facing ', 'ScrumMaster who was mainly tasked with communicating with the Product Owner. ', 'Initially I thought the “co-ScrumMaster” approach would not work because Agile evan¬ ', 'gelists do not seem to support it. However, this allowed the junior Agilists to feel more ', 'comfortable taking on the team facing ScrumMaster role. ', '', 'I am not aware of success stories where the ScrumMaster was distributed from the ', 'team. That does not mean it cannot exist. In fact, it is highly probable that there are such ', 'cases but the lack of supporting information could indicate there are rare cases or that ', 'more research needs to be explored in this area. ', '', 'Involve the Users Early: After one year from the start of the project, the client brought ', 'in an additional resource that functioned as a subject matter expert. The idea was to ', 'alleviate the barrage of questions on the Product Owner. However, the subject matter ', 'expert was not empowered to make decisions. Often she would have to go back to the ', 'Product Owner for clarification or confirmation. This approach introduced an unneces¬ ', 'sary layer of communication. Furthermore, neither the Product Owner nor the subject ', '', '', '240 ', '', '', 'M. Rajpal ', '', '', 'matter expert was an active user and Agile projects require active participation from the ', 'users [7]. The users did not have an active role in the project. ', '', 'On later projects, the end users were more than happy to provide feedback. As we ', 'listened to their concerns, they felt their trepidations were being addressed. Including ', 'users early on in the process tends to give them a finer grain of control over the project [8] . ', '', 'Get Buy-in From the Top: It seemed that the executives (or possibly the organization) ', 'were not quite ready to make the switch the Agile. Or maybe they just assumed it would ', 'be seamless. Agile migrations are not free from issues and there will be obstacles to ', 'overcome. “If you don’t involve your executives in the move to Agile, there is a good ', 'chance that they will stop the move as soon as they learn of any issues with the migra¬ ', 'tion.” [9]. Having dismissed the sprint review, the executives were even less engaged ', 'at a time where they needed to be more involved. ', '', 'On successive projects, we posted displays (aka information radiators) for everybody ', '(including executives) to see. Posting an impediments list prompted executives to ', 'inquire about the impediment and eventually aid in removing it. For example, one of ', 'my teams listed “Administrator Access” as an impediment. Essentially, the team did not ', 'have the ability to install tools on their development machines without going through a ', 'formal approval process. It turned out that one of the executives heard this from other ', 'people and also experienced this pain point. Consequently, the executive authorized all ', 'team members to have Administrator access. However, this example worked well ', 'because the executive walked past the information radiator many times a day. In many ', 'cases, executives are not located anywhere near Agile teams. ', '', 'Retrospectives Are Necessary: Even though the retrospectives encouraged good ', 'discussion, they were completely ineffective especially once they were cancelled. ', 'Following the project, I researched various techniques. Almost everyone I reached out ', 'to pointed me to the book, “Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great”. There ', 'were many helpful suggestions for the novice and also the more experienced. On most ', 'projects I introduce the “Timeline” activity [3] for the Sprint 1 retrospective. It seems ', 'to be a good way to get the team (as well as a rookie facilitator) accustomed to retro¬ ', 'spectives. The book provides many other activities for the other retrospectives so the ', 'team is not repeating the same thing again and again. ', '', 'Incorporate the Necessary Tools: On the failed project there were many areas that ', 'could have been incorporated to bridge the communication gap. For instance, equipping ', 'all computers with webcams would have allowed distributed resources to have a face- ', 'to-face conversation. Also, teams could have adjusted their working hours to have some ', 'overlap with the other teams. Even a one-hour overlap would have made a significant ', 'difference. Furthermore, it seemed that the travel budget was not adequate. When travel ', 'was requested it was quickly denied due to cost. It is difficult to say whether or not these ', 'things would have made a noticeable difference. However, it is likely that these modi¬ ', 'fications would have gotten the teams closer to a totally integrated scrums model. ', '', 'On other projects, I have used add-on tools that facilitated more collaboration. For ', 'example, lira is a popular issue tracking system I used on some Agile projects. There ', 'are many supporting tools for lira but one that stands out is Hipchat. Hipchat facilitates ', 'instant messaging, screen sharing, and video. It can also produce notifications once the ', '', '', 'Lessons Learned from a Failed Attempt at Distributed Agile 241 ', '', '', 'state of a Jira item has been modified. On smaller projects, my teams benefited from ', 'Kanban boards by using tools like Trello and AgileZen. While these tools can make our ', 'lives easier it should be noted, “technology can maintain relationships but it won’t build ', 'them” [4]. ', '', '3.2 Managing Requirements is a Necessity ', '', 'Time and Materials (T&M) Over Fixed Price: Fixed price can lead to false expect¬ ', 'ations and mistrust [8]. On this fixed price project, the client felt they could change the ', 'requirements whenever they wanted, and the end product would be delivered as ', 'expected, at the same cost, and on time. Ensuing projects that were T&M based allowed ', 'the client to make modifications but it also allowed the teams to incorporate quality, ', 'present alternatives, and build trust by delivering often. In fact, it was noted that while ', 'extreme programming (XP) practices are possible for fixed price, it is not proven because ', 'accurate estimates of scope are necessary [6]. ', '', 'Change is Inevitable: Requirements will change regardless of how much analysis is ', 'spent before the development work commences, so change requests are inevitable. ', 'However, many large organizations cause change requests to be as tedious as possible. ', 'In this case it simply detracts from getting the work done. Later projects involving ', 'smaller organizations viewed change requests as a waste of time. Other projects ', 'addressed changed requests by accepting the fact that change will happen. Sometimes ', 'that meant the user stories were pushed to another sprint. In other cases, the team put in ', 'extra time to accommodate the change to meet their sprint goals. ', '', 'Requirements Must Be Understandable and Decomposed: For the most part, the new ', 'requirements were very complex and the teams were pressured to complete them in a ', 'single sprint, which rarely happened. Since the team did not have the necessary availa¬ ', 'bility of the Product Owner, there were many times where they had to guess which ', 'seldom ended well. Subsequent projects incorporated user stories as their primary means ', 'of acquiring requirements. This worked much better for everyone. The requirements ', 'became much clearer when the business analysts were able to write user stories as ', 'crosscutting layers. For example, instead of taking on a pure database user story, we ', 'developed a screen (will some functionality) that crossed the user interface, business ', 'logic, and database layers. Developers favored this approach because it allowed them ', 'to complete the user stories within the sprint. ', '', '4 Remaining Challenges ', '', 'This report has explored the challenges associated with communication and require¬ ', 'ments using Agile approaches. The results provide information that can be useful in ', 'overcoming these challenges. However, there are some challenges that require further ', 'investigation. ', '', '', '242 ', '', '', 'M. Rajpal ', '', '', 'Lack of Support: Many Agile implementations (especially from a grassroots movement) ', 'struggle to gain support from the organization. In fact, there are those that are never ', 'going to accept Agile and they may even demean you for trying to promote it. ', '', 'Empowerment: It is often the case that people are given a title of empowerment without ', 'the power to go with it. In Agile, there are cases where ScrumMasters are not empowered ', 'to remove roadblocks or Product Owners are not empowered to make decisions without ', 'the approval of their superior. ', '', 'User Involvement: Sometimes users do not want to take part in the Agile process as they ', 'feel it adds to their workload. As a result, the task of writing user stories may fall upon ', 'the requirements engineer. In other instances, management may decide that the end users ', 'do not need to be involved until the modifications are deployed to production. ', '', 'Scrum Ceremonies: Some (if not all) of the ceremonies can become redundant. Teams ', 'often get bored of repeating the ceremonies in the same manner. This may cause the ', 'effectiveness to come into question. ', '', '5 Conclusion ', '', 'The paper presents challenges that prevent Agile teams from performing at a high level. ', 'Ultimately, organizations need to decide whether or not Agile is a good fit. If it is a good ', 'fit then they need to be prepared to make changes (in management style, working envi¬ ', 'ronment, team’s skills, and close relationships with users [8]) and support it across all ', 'relevant levels.

', '', '2 The Case: The Brownfield Project ', '', 'Context. A case study of a major software development project was conducted from ', 'September 2014 to December 2015. The project, referred to as the Brownfield project, ', 'was a large-scale agile development effort involving over 120 participants over 3 years ', 'from 2011 to late 2014. The project was organized as four development - or ‘Scrum’ ', 'teams and one team loosely related to the project developing a business intelligence ', 'solution. Experience from this project is especially interesting in many respects. Firstly, ', 'the supplier, the Consulting company had just recently before starting on the Brownfield ', 'project been part of a prestigious large-scale agile software development project that ', 'was especially known nationally for being a success - and often used as a template for ', 'other large-scale agile projects in Norway. Secondly, the customer had tried two times ', 'before earlier in the 2000s to implement the Brownfield project and failed considerably ', 'in both cases. ', '', 'This report is written based on 20 in depth-interviews of project participants, 2 ', 'workshops, project documents as well as numerous meetings with different participants. ', 'Additionally, one of the authors was the project manager for the Consulting company ', 'on the project during the third deliverable. ', '', 'Three authors have written this report: one practitioner, one student, and one ', 'academic. One of us was the project manager for the project during the last of three ', 'deliverables. He has more than 10 years of experience as a project manager on large ', 'software development projects and agile projects in particular. The other author is ', 'currently a researcher working on a scientific case study of the project. Previously, he ', 'has also been a practitioner for many years participating in large-scale agile software ', 'development projects. The third author is a student of information systems management ', 'and innovation, who also has a background in industry. Obviously, our differences in ', 'experiences and background made the writing process especially interesting, as we were ', 'able to challenge each other’s biases. ', '', '', '246 ', '', '', 'K.H. Rolland et al. ', '', '', 'The scrum-based delivery model. The project followed a Scrum-based model that ', 'interestingly had been used by a recent large-scale project where the Consulting ', 'company was involved. This previous project was perceived as highly successful, and ', 'is generally regarded as ‘best practice’ for doing large scale agile in the Norwegian IT ', 'industry. ', '', 'The Scrum-based delivery model is characterized by splitting up a large project in ', 'different deliverables as shown in Fig. 1 below. For each deliverable then, a semi-agile ', 'process is followed by first defining user stories, then architectural design, overall UX ', 'design, and refinement of user stories - but with a minimum of effort not to plan things ', 'in too much detail.

', '', 'Project description and goals. The Brownfield project was established in order to ', 'replace The Client’s outdated legacy IT systems with a new integrated system for case ', 'management. The new system was to be based on a Service Oriented Architecture, with ', 'support for integration with a large number of external and internal systems. In addition, ', 'the new system would include a web-based self-service solution aimed at the general ', 'public, as well as a rule-based application processing engine reducing the need for ', 'manual processing. ', '', 'The project thus set out with four main goals: ', '', '• To replace fragmented case management systems with one integrated system. ', '', '• To replace manual processing with automated, rule-based processing. ', '', '• To establish a self-service web interface for the general public. ', '', '• To decommission legacy systems. ', '', 'These goals were further elaborated in the form of a “dual goal matrix”, specifying main ', 'business goals and main IT goals for each deliverable. The business goals were divided ', 'by functional areas, reflecting the existing organizational and system structure. The IT ', 'goals were more focused on architectural requirements, cutting across the functional ', 'areas in order to establish what was seen as a desirable “future state” of architecture in ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Tailoring Agile in the Large: Experience and Reflections ', '', '', '247 ', '', '', 'the organization. The background for the two subsets of goals was somewhat divided: ', 'The business requirements were related to limitations of the existing system portfolio ', 'in supporting new government regulations, interfacing with external parties, and effi¬ ', 'ciency in case management and processing. The technical requirements were driven by ', 'the strong internal technical organization’s vision of a future-proof, platform inde¬ ', 'pendent architecture which would allow the organization to “pick and choose” technical ', 'components in a vendor independent manner. These technical requirements were ', 'communicated in the form of architectural standards and policies. In addition, the ', 'Customer had already purchased a number of technical components as part of existing ', 'vendor purchasing agreements for related database systems. The Consulting company ', 'was asked to consider the use of these components in developing the new architectural ', 'platform. At the outset of the project, it quickly became clear that the Customer was ', 'overwhelmed by the amount of work required in order to determine and specify require¬ ', 'ments. The technical and architectural requirements seemed especially unclear, and ', 'resulted in a lot of time being spent by both parties in order to better understand what ', 'was actually required to be developed by the Consulting company. As a result, the first ', 'deliverable was delayed, and ultimately merged with the second planned deliverable in ', 'an effort to save time by skipping one of the planned production migrations. ', '', '3 Agile Method Tailoring in the Project ', '', 'After a much troubled start related to scaling challenges and architecture complexity ', 'during the first deliverable, the project was turnaround and the second and third deliv¬ ', 'erables were portrayed fairly successful by both supplier and customer - including their ', 'end users. Noteworthy, we came across the following new practices as the project had ', 'been ‘turned around’: ', '', '(1) ‘Task forces’ were established across teams to deal with common challenges such ', 'as performance issues; ', '', '(2) ‘Champion roles’ were implemented working across teams on specific technology ', 'issues for example databases or java scripting; ', '', '(3) ‘Specifying up front’ in terms of close collaboration between customer and supplier ', 'in preparing user stories, uncovering dependencies and prototyping prior to sprints; ', '', '(4) ‘Re-distributing development tasks’ within the current sprint in order to utilize ', 'competence across teams and scale the project. ', '', '(5) ‘Mini demos’ were improvised in the middle of sprints to get users’ feedback as ', 'soon as possible, and to do smaller adjustments to features and/or interaction design; ', '', 'We will briefly describe these practices in more detail in the following sub-sections ', 'below. ', '', 'Task forces. In traditional agile development, participants in projects are supposed ', 'to work within teams. In this project, however, an informal role of temporarily ‘task ', 'forces’ was formed. Task forces were formed on developers’ own initiative for tack¬ ', 'ling specific pressing problems relevant across the four development teams. These ', 'were typically problems related to non-functional requirements. For example, ', '', '', '', '248 ', '', '', 'K.H. Rolland et al. ', '', '', 'security issues, performance problems and ways of integrating with external systems ', 'and standardized components. ', '', 'Task forces were initially not initiated by management, but grew out of a need ', 'recognized by some developers at one of the development teams. The developers recog¬ ', 'nized that they had common problems across teams and started informally to sit together ', 'with fellow developers belonging to a different team. This practice was later sanctioned ', 'and even facilitated by team leaders and project management for better solving problems ', 'across teams. ', '', 'Our analysis is that task forces not only solved common problems, but also greatly ', 'helped coordinating work across teams and helped building a more common under¬ ', 'standing across teams both regarding software architecture and business domain. In this ', 'respect, task forces became a necessary addition to scrum-of-scrums in that they had a ', 'much more detailed focus on solving specific problems. ', '', 'Champion roles. While the task forces explained above were of a more temporary ', 'nature, the champion roles were more permanent. Champion roles also started bottom- ', 'up from a perceived need in the teams to coordinate and standardize certain ways of ', 'doing things in the project. For example, it was established champion roles for java ', 'scripting and databases ensuring a common way of working with and implementing ', 'these technologies across teams. ', '', 'Champion roles rotated among competent individuals, and over time this also ', 'became more sanctioned and facilitated by management. ', '', 'Similar to task forces, but more stable - champion roles implied better inter-team ', 'coordination and standardization of working. Additionally, it also increased learning ', 'among teams and members from different teams. ', '', 'Specifying up front. In collaboration with the customer, the project started to have a ', 'more formal process before a new sprint was initiated and sprint planning started. This ', 'process where referred to as the ‘ready-to-sprint’ processes, and engaged all the relevant ', 'actors for coordinating and planning of the work to be conducted in the upcoming sprint ', 'in more detail. Depending on the specific challenges and type of work to be conducted ', 'the process ensured that all involved actors had contributed and were coordinated. This ', 'process could include further specification of user stores, flow diagrams, description of ', 'technical as well as functional dependencies, and more overall architectural issues. ', '', 'A crucial skill in agile development is to conduct the Product owner role and the ', 'ability to create Epics and user stories upfront the sprints. The project organization ', 'addressed these issues by including two persons from the customer in each scrum team ', 'with the role “functional responsible”. The role was part of the customers Product owner ', 'team, and participated both in specification work and to cope with functional clarifica¬ ', 'tions throughout the sprints. ', '', 'Already from the first sprints conducted, it proved major challenges to establish ', 'effective ways of handling the product backlog, agile collaboration that supported both ', 'common understanding of specifications, ensure consistent architecture implementation ', '', '', '', 'Tailoring Agile in the Large: Experience and Reflections ', '', '', '249 ', '', '', 'across teams and handling clarifications of upcoming issues. Corrective actions were ', 'issued by training the Product owner in necessary skills and adding trained functional ', 'architects to the scrum teams. The actions, which were taken, did help to some extent, ', 'but it was necessary to make some fundamental adaptations to ensure a more robust ', 'process. ', '', 'Our analysis is that this made the initiation of the sprints more effective and ensured ', 'that key participants were coordinated irrespective of team and role in the project. ', 'Although this practice inevitably implies more planning up-front seemingly in conflict ', 'with the agile principles and practices, we will argue that this practice is more aligned ', 'to the characteristics of large-scale agile where there is an increased need for more ', 'standardization and coordination across teams and roles. ', '', 'Re-distribution of work tasks. Partly as a consequence of the previous practice, the ', 'project got increased flexibility to re-distribute work tasks across teams within a sprint. ', 'This practice was a part of striking a balance between the need for competence and ', 'efficiency at the one hand, and the evenly distribution of work among teams on the other. ', 'The practice was especially useful in the last sprints of a deliverable when user stories ', 'belonging to different domains did not imply equal distribution of work effort between ', 'teams. ', '', 'Again, this practice may seem odd, and even unproductive, from the perspective of ', '‘textbook agile’. However, this gave the project as a whole better utilization of the teams ', 'and also helped spread competence across teams. On the other hand, we also see that ', 'this practice should be used with care and only for smaller tasks when necessary typically ', 'late in the project. ', '', 'Mini demos. The project had some especially competent project members who had ', 'long experience from other large-scale agile projects. Some of the practices they adopted ', 'from a previous project were the practice of ‘mini demos’. The crucial point in doing ', 'mini demos in the middle of sprints was to demo features as soon as they were developed ', 'irrespective of when. Typically, this was practiced as a way of negotiating and getting ', 'feedback on details regarding functionality and interaction design. In that way, devel¬ ', 'opers and designers could easily do the last finishing touches right away, without going ', 'through a more formal demo and going back to those details in the following sprint. ', '', 'Thus, these mini demos both made the ongoing communication and collaboration ', 'with the customer smooth and at the same time reduced the administrative cost for both ', 'parties. ', '', '4 Implications for Tailoring Agile in the Large ', '', 'In this section we propose some practical guidelines for tailoring agile in the large. We ', 'do not want to be too bold and generalize too much, as guidelines as these could easily ', 'be misinterpreted and used in contexts that are not comparable to our project. However, ', '', '', '', '250 ', '', '', 'K.H. Rolland et al. ', '', '', 'we argue that there is something more general worth mentioning based on our ', 'experience. The suggested guidelines are: ', '', '(1) Experiment with new practices. For tailoring agile in the large, projects should ', 'experiment with practices that highlight functional and technical interdependencies ', 'in the software being developed. This would help improve coordinating and ', 'communicating across teams and roles. ', '', '(2) Facilitate novel practices to emerge. It should be underscored that project ', 'managers should be wary of trying to enforce predefined tailored practices. ', 'However, although agile methods and principles tend to emphasize bottom-up ', 'initiatives, successful tailoring can be both bottom-up or top-down initiated. ', '', '(3) “Record, and move on”. Do not wait for sorting out contractual details. Try to ', 'establish trust to that pragmatic decisions can be made and temporary solutions can ', 'be sought. ', '', '(4) Improve inter-team coordination. Establish both long term ‘communities of ', 'practice’ and short term ‘task forces’ across teams. ', '', '(5) Scale the project in an evolutionary manner. Plan for a ramp-up phase allowing ', 'customers to get accustomed to the working process. Conduct training activities to ', 'ensure customers are aware of what is required of them. ', '', '(6) Adjust content in sprints. Allow time for customers to absorb and process new ', 'information, and coordinate requirement elicitation with stakeholders in their ', 'organization. This can be done by inserting technical sprints where programmers ', 'focus on technical tasks, in order to allow customers a “programmer’s holiday” [5]. ', '', '5 Concluding Remarks ', '', 'In this experience report we have emphasized the ways in which a large-scale agile ', 'software development effort has been tailored during the process. Here, tailoring was ', 'not done up-front, but rather emergent during the development over 3,5 years. Especially ', 'in this report we have highlighted and described five different practices and roles: (1) ', '‘Task forces’, (2) ‘Champion roles’, (3) ‘Specifying up front’, (4) ‘Re-distributing ', 'development tasks’, and (5) ‘Mini demos’. ', '', 'We argue that these novel practices are good examples of agile method tailoring ', 'reflecting the complexity and large-scale characteristics of the project. We do not argue ', 'that these actual practices denote any ‘ultimate way’ of tailoring agile projects, but more ', 'on an analytic level - that in succeeding with large-scale projects continuous tailoring ', 'throughout the process is necessary. ', '', 'In reflecting upon the establishment of these practices we discuss how some are ', 'bottom-up initiatives (1, 2 & 4) largely initiated, planned and coordinated among team ', 'members themselves with no or little management involvement. Whereas some practices ', 'can be described as a blend of bottom-up and top-down (3 & 5) where management are ', 'much more involved. ', '', 'Furthermore, we recognize that all of the practices turn out more emergent. They ', 'were not deliberately planned and adjusted ahead of starting the project - but emerged ', 'over time based on the involved actors’ experiences. Collectively, then, the project ', '', '', 'Tailoring Agile in the Large: Experience and Reflections ', '', '', '251 ', '', '', 'seems to preserve a sense of agility in terms of Teaming from change’. Additionally, ', 'interestingly, some of these practices are seemingly also in conflict with the agile prin¬ ', 'ciples - notably (3) focusing on planning. ', '', 'Acknowledgments.

', 'Growing the team with the right type of people has often proven difficult but was ', 'addressed in 2012 by the inception of the 7digital Technical Academy. The academy ', 'programme has completed its third iteration and has evolved through continuous ', 'improvement with regular inspection and adaption. In the first iteration, a key retro¬ ', 'spective resulted in a move to pull based learning; asking apprentices to solve real busi¬ ', 'ness problems and request sessions on the skills they needed to accomplish their objec¬ ', 'tives. The second iteration saw peer to peer learning and a self organising community ', 'develop amongst apprentices.

', '', '2 Background ', '', 'When searching for software development roles on the most popular recruitment ', 'websites the ratio of jobs requiring greater than two years’ experience to those requiring ', 'fewer is eight to one. Additionally, finding senior software developers, with greater than ', '5 years’ experience is notoriously difficult - so how do we provide the opportunity, to ', 'those with less experience, to work in a welcoming and learning oriented culture so that ', 'they can become senior members of our community? ', '', 'These problems are not unique to any company working in the tech sector but became ', 'more prevalent at 7digital when they focused on quality driven software development ', 'practices, as the requisite skills made experienced people even harder to find. ', '', '7digital was established in 2004 as a small start-up in London’s “Silicon Round¬ ', 'about”. After establishing itself in the first 5 years there was a marked switch to quality ', 'driven practices with the appointment of key people experienced in Agile and XP. The ', 'two development teams at the time totalled around twenty people, over half of the total ', 'organisation. As the technology platform expanded, so did the teams and the need to ', 'fulfil roles, and by 2011 the total head count for the Technology Team was forty with ', 'further plans for expansion. ', '', '2.1 Apprenticeships in Software Development ', '', 'In early 2012, senior members of the team looked to solve the common problem of a ', 'lack of experienced hands available to join the team. They researched efforts in the ', 'Software Craftsmanship community to utilise the master/apprenticeship format of more ', 'traditional trades. 8th Light [1] ran a programme that defined levels of craftsmanship in ', 'the team, with newer members joining as apprentices and being mentored by master ', 'craftsmen on a one-to-one basis. ', '', 'Other efforts of this one-to-one tuition style were attempted by Codemanship, and ', 'an interesting initiative at Accenture assigned groups of people to particular learning ', 'projects as they joined. One of the team leads at 7digital had experience in a classroom ', 'based training scheme during the agile transformation at Code weavers Ltd [2] involving ', 'short, focussed sessions away from the usual team room for new team members to try ', 'intensive learning on a particular topic. ', '', 'While many of these schemes had benefits, they didn’t directly fit with the team’s ', 'desire to expand and invest in the future. ', '', '“Education is the kindling of aflame, not the filling of a vessel. ” - Socrates ', '', '', '254 ', '', '', 'P. Shannon and M. Pool ', '', '', '2.2 Diversity ', '', 'A major opportunity the team saw with expanding through internally trained developers, ', 'was that they could attract a more diverse cohort. ', '', 'Gender diversity in the tech industry is a perennial yet slowly improving issue. The ', '7digital team hoped to improve the diversity of their team by offering a lower barrier to ', 'entry than their usual recruitment process. Research suggests [3] that female applicants ', 'are less likely to apply for positions that require assertions about experience or achieve¬ ', 'ment - they would only apply if they meet 100 % of requirements whereas men would ', 'apply when meeting only 60 % - so a programme which provided training and which ', 'emphasised a lack of requirement for experience was believed to be beneficial. ', '', 'Software development candidates are often products of education in a narrow field ', 'of study - Computer Science. The team felt that more diverse backgrounds would ', 'provide a wider selection of opinions, so a scheme that would be attractive to people in ', 'any field was most desirable. ', '', '3 Timeline ', '', 'Before the academy was created, a first attempt at addressing our recruitment needs with ', 'a lower barrier to entry began with an apprenticeship model similar to that at 8th Light. ', 'New team members, with some experience in programming, were assigned a mentor ', 'and were expected to pair and learn from that person during their daily development ', 'tasks. This proved disruptive to teams as they effectively lost a senior developer who ', 'spent most of their time teaching, especially in the initial three months. ', '', 'The following year, in 2012, we decided that a new approach should be taken and ', 'the Technical Academy was created. Following a gap of two years the second iteration ', 'began and then an opportunity one year later led to the running of the third. The ', 'programme is based in the London headquarters of 7digital with co-located teams. ', '', '3.1 The Inception of the Technical Academy ', '', 'Research into other organisations’ attempts at apprenticeship programmes led us to ', 'believe that we needed some structure, a curriculum and a clearly defined career path ', 'for the Technical Academy. While the efforts at Codeweavers Ltd. proved useful, the ', 'lack of direction meant it was not a key part of the team’s learning there. Efforts else¬ ', 'where resembled the initial efforts at 7digital so a committee was formed to discuss and ', 'decide upon how to proceed. ', '', 'An early agreement was reached that apprentices should be hired as full time devel¬ ', 'opers, with a permanent role and that the offer of a position was not dependent on ', 'completion of the academy. This would give the apprentices confidence and security ', 'that they had a job at 7digital and were just at the start of a potentially long and prosperous ', 'career. To ensure a level of protection for both the apprentices and the organisation they ', 'were given an extended six month probation period. ', '', '', 'Hire an Apprentice: Evolutionary Learning at the 7digital Technical Academy 255 ', '', '', '3.2 Hire an Apprentice: The First Iteration ', '', 'For the initial iteration we hired two new developers by advertising the role and ', 'contacting universities externally, and recruited one internal candidate through transfer ', 'from the operations team. Interviewing candidates with little or no experience in ', 'programming posed a challenge as the usual recruitment process involved working ', 'through a simple code kata. We decided that as the candidate was joining to both learn, ', 'and to write software, that this was still the best form of early assessment. Candidates ', 'paired with a senior developer on a simple test-driven development coding exercise. An ', 'observer would take notes, paying particular attention to how the candidate reacted to ', 'new concepts, such as test automation and refactoring, and how soon they could ', 'contribute to the conversation. ', '', 'Once apprentices had been selected the committee planned a curriculum. This ', 'included skills related to Agile software development and Lean practices, with sessions ', 'on subjects such as Test Driven Development, Theory of Constraints, Databases, ', 'DevOps, Continuous Delivery and Design Patterns. ', '', 'To help clarify what the apprenticeship entails, we produced a “path to becoming a ', '7digital developer” - this was a timeline encompassing an intensive “bootcamp”, ', 'tapering to less frequent sessions on basic techniques before moving into a term of ', 'specialisation and project work; it ended with graduation in week twenty-six. Graduation ', 'was a company-wide event involving presentations, drinks and gifts. ', '', '3.2.1 Adoption of Pull Based Learning ', '', 'It was identified early that apprentices were being asked to pair on tasks involving ', 'concepts they had not yet been taught. A problem here became evident when a team ', 'member was struggling to explain to an apprentice the concept of Dependency Injec¬ ', 'tion - a complex but widely used solution to software modularity. This was raised ', 'with the Academy coordinator who organised a dedicated classroom session on the ', 'topic. Following this the apprentice rejoined his previous pair, with an understanding ', 'of the concept and was then able to contribute to the continuing work. ', '', 'At a similar time we met with Professor Dave West, who had been running a unique ', 'degree programme at New Mexico Highlands University, USA [4]. This course had ', 'students, with no software development skills, working on commercial projects and ', 'requesting the skills they wanted to learn in order to accomplish their task. They used ', 'regular feedback, retrospectives and planning meetings to ensure they were developing ', 'the right skills to develop software. ', '', 'The success seen on Prof. West’s course, and in conjunction with our example above, ', 'led us to adopt pull-based learning; coordinators would talk to apprentices, tutors and ', 'team leads to organise group sessions on the topics that were currently of most relevance. ', '', '3.3 Evolution in the Academy: The Second Iteration ', '', 'Following a two year hiatus, we decided to reinstate the Technical Academy under a ', 'new coordinator. The driving force behind this decision was from members of the team, ', 'including prospective internal candidates, perceiving the successes of the first iteration. ', '', '', '256 ', '', '', 'P. Shannon and M. Pool ', '', '', 'Internal apprentices were thus self-selecting - one transfer to the Technology Team, and ', 'for the first time, one apprentice looking to up-skill in their existing, non-development ', 'role. Two external candidates were recruited as we had done in the first iteration. ', '', 'The broad structure of this iteration was much like the first, however each of the four ', 'apprentices was now assigned a tutor who was on hand to assist with any technical issues. ', 'During the “bootcamp” first term these tutors felt superfluous. ', '', 'In the weeks before the second iteration, the coordinator collated project ideas from ', 'teams in the wider business. ', '', '“The proposal should have clear interest to the business, but its implementation will be a proof ', '', 'of concept. ” ', '', 'At eight weeks the apprentices chose a project to implement over the following four ', 'months. Each project had a product owner who would help define requirements, and ', 'ensure continuous delivery practices were observed. With projects framed as real busi¬ ', 'ness products, apprentices were also encouraged to adopt practices such as test-driven ', 'development and Kanban, with Technical Academy stand-ups attended by stakeholders. ', 'While helping the apprentice, the tutor would check for clean code and good automated ', 'testing. ', '', 'In the latter terms the pull for technical sessions allowed the structured learning ', 'framework to fall away in favour of “just-in-time” planning. The cohort situated in ', 'disparate development teams, built up a strong community with equally disparate tech¬ ', 'nical skills; an environment highly conducive to peer-to-peer learning. ', '', 'Following a term two retrospective, apprentices took to pairing on their projects; this ', 'was of particular benefit to the apprentice not based in a development team. It also ', 'allowed apprentices to work confidently on a new and unfamiliar codebase. ', '', '3.4 Reflective Practice: The Third Iteration ', '', 'Just six months after the second 7digital Technical Academy the opportunity arose to ', 'take on another two apprentices. The academy was reinstated, this time coordinated by ', 'a Technical Academy alumnus. The academy started up with a total of six apprentices, ', 'after a short recruitment process and a number of existing speculative applications. Two ', 'new hires were made along with one internal transfer, with three apprentices from ', 'Operations and QA Teams looking to up-skill. ', '', 'Termly retrospectives produced a number of valuable actions. To foster an open ', 'environment for discussion, a weekly reading group was set up in which apprentices ', 'would discuss several, occasionally conflicting articles. Further, it was felt that some ', 'crucial topics were introduced, and swiftly left behind. The solution was to theme the ', 'week’s practical, classroom and reading group sessions, and then to gauge the appren¬ ', 'tices confidence level in that week’s topic. ', '', '3.4.1 Selecting Tutors ', '', 'Often the developer working directly with an apprentice is not the most suitable person ', 'to teach a given subject. It is thus more beneficial to select an appropriate tutor from a ', 'wider group, on a subject-by-subject basis. ', '', '', '', 'Hire an Apprentice: Evolutionary Learning at the 7digital Technical Academy 257 ', '', '', 'In the Technical Academy it is important that many and varied members of the ', 'organisation have direct contact with the apprentices. In contrast with the master- ', 'apprentice pattern, being exposed to diverse views within the team aids the apprentices ', 'in drawing their own perspectives on the values the team hopes to instill. It is felt that ', 'this is important in a team with a strong culture of shared responsibility. The academy ', 'is also a learning experience for the tutors themselves, many of whom are previous ', 'apprentices, and the more people involved, the greater this benefit. ', '', '', '4 Discussion ', '', 'Making the academy visible was a key goal from early on; both in terms of its operation ', 'and its efficacy. We managed the first part by advertising sessions more often and getting ', 'people outside the team involved in project work. The graduation ceremonies and project ', 'demonstrations also increased visibility. Within the teams though we wanted to show ', 'that the academy had a positive effect on throughput and cycle time. This was difficult ', 'as many other factors could influence these measures (continuous improvement, ', 'absence, team changes, changing business needs) but the general trend for teams with ', 'apprentices was that, after week six, apprentices were making a positive contribution. ', 'This was attributed to the additional person available for pairing and - following their ', 'intensive classroom sessions - apprentices were now adding value during these pairing ', 'sessions. ', '', 'Having someone with a new perspective, focusing on the detail and asking novel ', 'questions was itself advantageous, - one example being a simple observation resulting ', 'in a complete change in operation when an apprentice questioned whether we were ', 'encoding audio files in a mathematically suboptimal way. ', '', 'Qualitatively, the benefits of placing apprentices into development teams as soon as ', 'they arrived helping the apprentices to feel as though they were already an important ', 'and valued member of the Technology Team - this was crucial in fostering a supportive ', 'community. It also allowed the apprentice to easily join existing pairs and gain exposure ', 'to the team’s domain; something which cannot easily be taught during academy sessions. ', '', 'The feedback cycle of pairing, and subsequently discovering missing knowledge ', 'helped drive the tuition, through pull based learning. This “just-in-time” planning of ', 'sessions ensured tuition only on subjects that had a direct impact on the daily work of ', 'the apprentices, minimising the gap between learning and practicing those skills. ', 'Apprentices thus honed new skills through use, adding business value quickly. This ', 'resulted in a natural progression from isolated student to fully engaged team-member ', 'over the course of the six months. ', '', 'Retrospectives in the Technical Academy gradually became more frequent as the ', 'value they delivered to the learning process became apparent, and with regular contin¬ ', 'uous improvement these ideas were instilled in the apprentices’ daily practice. ', '', 'With larger cohorts, the community in the academy was slower to develop; a larger ', 'group meant apprentices would speak less readily in early open-forum sessions. Further¬ ', 'more, with a larger cohort less one-to-one tuition was available. While one-to-one tuition ', 'has its advantages, group tuition was more efficient when introducing the fundamentals ', '', '', '', '258 ', '', '', 'P. Shannon and M. Pool ', '', '', 'of a new concept. Pull-based group tuition also exposes apprentices to topics they may ', 'not yet have faced. On the whole, a balance of group tuition and pairing with other ', 'developers is more effective than either technique alone. Eventually a larger cohort ', 'became advantageous as the drive for technical sessions rapidly increased as the appren¬ ', 'tices made progress with their technically-diverse work. With so many ongoing projects, ', 'the challenge then came in keeping up with the pull for such a diverse set of topics. ', 'Grouping these topics in a loose, longer-term curriculum was a method introduced to ', 'prioritise the sessions. ', '', 'Tutors and coordinators also benefited from the academy, through areas of personal ', 'development and daily variety in their work. The sense of purpose and achievement ', 'garnered from contributing to the next generation of software developers, and ensuring ', 'they were taught quality driven practices, made it worthwhile for those donating their ', 'time. Tutors and team members that were helping apprentices were also challenged on ', 'their knowledge, as they were suddenly required to teach what they’d previously taken ', 'as rote. When Technical Academy graduate, Sophie, was asked to pair with a new ', 'apprentice she said: ', '', '“You have to really think about what you’re doing and it makes you realise how much you do ', '', 'actually know. I still question myself though, but that helps me to learn too. ” ', '', '', '4.1 The Tech Academy in the Wider Organisation ', '', 'A key change in the third iteration was to have projects backed by the 7digital product ', 'team. This improved alignment with adding business value and the projects gained more ', 'prominence in the wider business. ', '', 'There were some initial disagreements from other teams about the impact of the ', 'academy as it does require team members to spend time away from their usual daily ', 'work. We investigated ways we could measure and adapt, and elected to look at the ', 'things already measured (throughput and cycle time) while getting regular feedback via ', 'retrospectives, one-to-one meetings and reports to senior team members. One of our ', 'teams that took on an apprentice in the third iteration had a cycle time of around 2 days ', '', '', '» ', '', '» 0 ', '', '', '» ', '', 'w o ', '', 'MOO ', '', '', '', 'Fig. 1. Cycle time for content discovery team during their apprentice’s tenure ', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Hire an Apprentice: Evolutionary Learning at the 7digital Technical Academy 259 ', '', '', 'before she joined. For the following 6 weeks the cycle time rose to 4.3 days peaking at ', '5 days before reducing again back to 1.7 days (see Fig. 1). ', '', 'When Miles joined the Content Development Team he initially had a detrimental ', 'effect on their throughput, reducing it to 1-2 minimum marketable features delivered ', 'per week for about 8 weeks. The middle period of his tenure in that team saw a stable ', 'throughput which then increased towards the end of his apprenticeship. We also added ', 'more people to the team in his sixth month which saw the momentum in the team further ', 'accelerate with a peak of 13 features delivered in one week. ', '', 'The pattern based on our metrics appears to make a team slow down for the initial ', '6-8 weeks, then return to the team’s previous pace for the middle part of the appren¬ ', 'ticeship. Within the last month or two of an apprentice’s tenure a team sees the ', 'throughput increase and cycle time decrease as the apprentice contributes more. While ', 'other factors could be affecting this, the general feeling of teams is that apprentices add ', 'value early on but notably from 4 months onwards. ', '', '4.2 Future Directions ', '', 'An interesting consideration is the comparison between former Technical Academy ', 'developers and those hired from other companies. Shared team values seem to be more ', 'prominent in the academy graduates as they’ve been trained specifically by the existing ', 'team, and not had to forget the ways of their previous teams. However, this meant that ', 'fewer tried-and-tested ideas come from apprentices versus seasoned developers so the ', 'trade-off meant that a balance between new ideas, team cohesion and well known prac¬ ', 'tices exists. ', '', 'We considered alternative approaches prior to setting up the first Technical Academy ', '(Sect. 3) but have since adopted new practices that should aid in training inexperienced ', 'developers. Mob programming is a good example of a practice we now use more often ', 'that is well positioned to easily spread knowledge. We’ll investigate its use as a learning ', 'tool in future academy iterations. ', '', 'With the experience of three successful Technical Academies behind us, and a ', 'Technology Team comprised of nine strong graduates and numerous experienced tutors, ', '7digital is in a stronger position than ever to run a fourth iteration. One might question ', 'if we should ever stop, or why we would wait between iterations, or why we might limit ', 'the number of apprentices in each cohort, and the answer is quite simple; we do not want ', 'to overload the team with apprentices. Having more apprentices will still require effort ', 'from teams during the time spent pairing, and diluting the number of senior developers ', 'in the team would burden them with additional responsibility. We have discussed the ', 'possibility of sharing sessions with other local organisations though, so that we can get ', 'more value from each session by teaching their apprentices too. ', '', '5 Conclusion ', '', 'There is a strong feeling at 7digital that the Technical Academy programme has been a ', 'success. All of the externally hired apprentices are still with the team, and despite their ', '', '', '260 ', '', '', 'P. Shannon and M. Pool ', '', '', 'experience being lower than that of their peers, they contribute at an equivalent level. ', 'The team’s gender balance is higher than it was with a notably more relaxed and open ', 'atmosphere that promotes a variety of ideas. The mixture of people’s background also ', 'contributes to this. Engagement in team development throughout the team has improved, ', 'with discussion on career progression, increased knowledge sharing and collaboration ', 'between teams. ', '', 'As more senior developers have grown in their careers they have appreciated being ', 'given the chance to pass on their knowledge through the academy. This interesting side ', 'effect has increased retention of more experienced team members. Having their knowl¬ ', 'edge questioned too has surprisingly resulted in a motivation to ensure we are following ', 'good practices and promoted learning at all experience levels. ', '', 'Hiring has been easier; the best example with the replacement of a senior developer ', 'with two apprentices in half the time it took to find the previous senior hire. We’ve also ', 'hired more women into a variety of roles than previous years. ', '', 'The existence of this paper is a key example of the benefit the Technical Academy ', 'has had on the team and organisation. It is motivating for the team to know that they are ', 'well regarded by peers in the community and that they have done something unique to ', 'solve a common industry problem. It gives team members a sense of purpose other than ', 'satisfying the needs of the organisation so 7digital will definitely be running the ', 'programme again in the future.

', '', '2 My Journey as a Female Software Engineer ', '', 'In this section I will describe the experiences I have had within my career, the difficulties ', 'that I have faced as a woman, and how my journey has become easier and more enjoyable ', 'since I started working with XP. I will cover the following topics: Non-XP Workplaces, ', 'Imposter Syndrome and its Effects, and finally The Welcoming Environment of XP. ', '', '2.1 Non-XP Workplaces ', '', 'I have 17 years’ experience in the profession, but due to a four-year career break in the ', 'middle, it is twenty-one years since I started my first software engineering job. At that ', 'point I had just graduated from an MSc in Computation, which was a “conversion” ', 'course - designed to transform people from diverse academic backgrounds into computer ', 'graduates. My previous degree was a BSc in Mathematics and Philosophy. It was 1995, ', 'and Agile and XP were barely heard of. ', '', 'During the course of the MSc, we were told that the main careers available to us ', 'would fall broadly into two categories: Analysis, and Development. The course was ', 'a popular course, and split quite evenly between men and women. It was noticeable ', 'that the women tended to be drawn towards analysis, with the men being attracted to ', 'coding. But personally I was more excited by code than anything else. The object- ', 'oriented C++ we were taught was very attractive to my logical, analytical, puzzle- ', 'loving brain. ', '', 'It didn’t surprise me to find that I was the only female developer in my first job. ', 'I was used to being in a minority - as a mathematics undergraduate, myself and my ', 'fellow female students represented approximately 10 % of the total population. I was ', 'also used to an accompanying feeling of inferiority: In this case it seemed to me that my ', 'male colleagues knew everything there was to know about computing, whereas I had ', 'walked straight into the job after a year’s study. ', '', 'I suppose it was at this point that a thought took root in my brain, which I have never ', 'quite lost: These men know so much more than me. I’m only a girl, I’ll never catch up. ', 'This is a common experience for women in our industry, and in fact for anyone operating ', 'in an environment as a member of a group which suffers from an adverse stereotype. ', '', '', '', 'How XP Can Improve the Experiences of Female Software Developers ', '', '', '263 ', '', '', 'That is to say, assumptions are often made about women in technology which suggest ', 'they will not have the skills they need to succeed. The general term for the way people ', 'respond to this is Stereotype Threat, and it is discussed at more length in section three ', 'of this paper. ', '', 'It’s worth stating at this point that I have never seriously believed that men have a ', 'superior intellect to women. But the inner voice which tells me I’m inferior is one that ', 'sneaks in without my permission. It curls up without me noticing, and can stay there for ', 'quite a while before I spot it and shoo it away (I now know that this voice has a name: ', 'It is called unconscious bias, and I will describe this more in section three). ', '', 'Between them, my first three jobs in software engineering lasted twelve years (four ', 'years, then one, then seven). There was one feature that all these experiences had in ', 'common: I found it hard to ask questions. When I was struggling with a piece of work, ', 'my approach tended to go like this: ', '', '1. Try to work it out on my own. I was proud, and hated the thought that people might ', 'think I was ignorant - particularly if they thought I was ignorant because I was a ', 'woman. ', '', '2. Stall. If I was stuck and too proud or scared to ask for help, I would simply cease ', 'work. Daily stand-ups were unheard of, we worked alone, and we were given large ', 'tasks which could last several weeks, so it was possible to do very little work for ', 'some time before anyone noticed. ', '', '3. Ask for help. There were three problems with this approach: ', '', 'a. It meant admitting that I didn’t know what I was doing. ', '', 'b. It meant interrupting someone. Everyone always seemed to be very busy. ', '', 'c. When people explained things, this involved me looking over their shoulder ', 'while they whizzed through complex concepts at break-neck pace. I would ', 'sometimes end up none the wiser. ', '', '2.2 Imposter Syndrome and its Effects ', '', 'For those first ten years, I suffered significantly from self-doubt. I rose to the position ', 'of senior developer very quickly, and always got good feedback. I loved writing code ', 'and took it seriously. By all objective standards, I was in fact good at my job. But I still ', 'believed that most of my colleagues knew more than me. ', '', 'I frequently suffered from imposter syndrome, i.e. the idea that I was not good enough ', 'for the role, and would be “found out”. This is not unique to women - men can suffer ', 'from it too - and not all women have it. But it tends to be common amongst women in ', 'IT, and it’s not difficult to see why: If you’re part of a minority, you feel like you don’t ', 'fit in. Like you’re an imposter. ', '', 'After those first twelve years as a software engineer, I was made redundant. At that ', 'point I had been with the same company for seven years, but my interest in the job had ', 'waned significantly. There were several factors at play: ', '', '1. I had several times asked to work on the more interesting and complex software, but ', 'had repeatedly been denied this opportunity. ', '', '', '', '264 C. Sudbery ', '', '', '2. I had started working a four-day week. My best guess as to why I might have been ', 'denied the opportunity to work on the more interesting software, based on conver¬ ', 'sations with other colleagues, was that because I worked reduced hours, I wasn’t ', 'taken seriously. People working on the really exciting stuff were expected to work ', 'evenings and weekends, and of course five days during the week. ', '', '3. I wasn’t giving the job my full attention. It was a vicious circle: I wasn’t given ', 'interesting work to do, so I focused more on hobbies and family, which meant that ', 'I was taken less seriously, which resulted in me paying less attention to my job. ', '', 'So, when I was offered voluntary redundancy, the decision to leave was not hard. In ', 'my exit interview, it was suggested I might try being a social worker! This did not appeal ', 'to me. ', '', '', '2.3 The Welcoming Environment of XP ', '', 'By the time I was made redundant, I was very bored of my job. My skills had stagnated ', 'so much, that as well as having very little enthusiasm for finding another software role, ', 'I doubted my ability to find anything new. As a result of these factors, I left the career ', 'altogether. ', '', 'After four years out of the industry, I realised that I was more suited to software ', 'development than anything else. I decided to return. I was honest about my out-of-date ', 'skills, and got myself a job with a company that specialised in taking on graduates and ', 'training them up. It was a revelation. Because of the emphasis on training, employees ', 'were not only encouraged, they were exhorted to ask as many questions as possible. ', 'There was no problem with people being too busy to help. Everyone in the company ', 'was expected to both ask and answer as many questions as possible. ', '', 'The teams I worked with had daily stand-ups, where each team member would report ', 'on what they were doing and flag up any problems. The company’s design methodology ', 'was largely waterfall, but the cultures of communication and collaboration were filtering ', 'through from XP working practices in other parts of the industry. This included regular ', 'and in-depth code reviews, and an introduction to the concept of clean code. ', '', 'All of this helped to counter the problems I had experienced before, in the following ', 'ways: ', '', '1. If I got stuck, I knew that someone would be eager to help me. ', '', '2. Daily stand-ups meant that there was nowhere for me to hide. If I had problems, I ', 'had to admit them. This was liberating. ', '', '3. My code was regularly reviewed in depth - so that I was always getting feedback. ', '', '4. The emphasis on clean code meant that I and my peers were focused on making our ', 'code accessible to each other. ', '', 'I was now back in the career and enjoying myself enormously. The idea that it was ', 'OK to ask questions was exhilarating. It also helped that I had those twelve years of ', 'experience behind me, so I no longer felt like everybody else was more experienced ', 'than me. ', '', '', '', 'How XP Can Improve the Experiences of Female Software Developers 265 ', '', '', 'I deliberately made coding my hobby, and got involved in events run by organisations ', 'like XP Manchester [3]. This meant that I was learning about such practices as TDD ', 'and pair programming. This excited me, and I was able to move to a more XP-focused ', 'company. My progress at this point accelerated rapidly. It wasn’t long before I gained ', 'the confidence to become a contractor, at which point I moved between several compa¬ ', 'nies on various contracts, and experienced several different implementations of XP. ', '', 'My confidence increased, but when I felt the old insecurities creeping back in, ', 'I decided to approach specific colleagues and ask them to act as sponsors or mentors on ', 'my behalf. I also gained the security to discuss the value of positive feedback with my ', 'line manager. I have learnt over time that, because of the various insecurities I face as ', 'a minority within this profession, I benefit enormously from explicit encouragement. ', 'I believe that there is level of openness and communication implicit within XP that has ', 'given me the strength to ask for this kind of support. ', '', '3 Discussing Lessons Learnt: Attracting ', 'More Women Through XP ', '', 'This section describes the lessons I have learnt as a woman working with XP, and how ', 'they might be used in order to encourage more women into XP teams, and enhance the ', 'experiences of the women already there. This will include the following sub-sections: ', 'The Importance of Diversity Within XP, Stereotype Threat and Unconscious Bias, and ', 'finally The Positive Impact of XP. ', '', '3.1 The Importance of Diversity Within XP ', '', 'It may or may not be true that the number of women in XP is a bit higher than elsewhere ', 'in the industry, but even if it is, they are still in the significant minority. It’s important ', 'that we don’t simply sit back, cross our arms and say “Oh, we use XP. We don’t have ', 'a problem with women in IT. We’ve solved that one already.” There is still room for ', 'improvement, and XP practitioners have an even greater responsibility than elsewhere ', 'in the industry to increase the numbers of women in tech. This is true for several reasons: ', '', 'XP emphasises the importance of seeing things from the end user’s perspective. This ', 'is helped when we have things in common with our end users. Obviously those end users ', 'are as diverse as our populations are. The more diversity we have within our teams, the ', 'better chance we have of appreciating our end users’ experiences. ', '', 'Also, XP is a forward-looking movement which emphasises flexibility, change ', 'and progress. As agilists, we value individuals and interactions over processes and ', 'tools, therefore if there is any group of people (for instance, women) whose ability ', 'to contribute towards their teams is compromised in any way, then this should be a ', 'matter of importance within the XP community. ', '', '', '266 C. Sudbery ', '', '', '3.2 Stereotype Threat and Unconscious Bias ', '', 'Stereotype threat describes the experience of any group who suffer from negative ster¬ ', 'eotypes. In the case of women in technology (and also men in the caring professions, as ', 'just one other example), these negative stereotypes manifest as a general assumption ', 'that they will not have the skills they need to succeed. Such damaging ideas put people ', 'under threat, because they constantly feel they have to disprove them. ', '', 'There is a large body of research which supports the statements I will make in this ', 'section. Several examples are referred to in the excellent book Delusions of Gender by ', 'Cordelia Fine [4], and I will quote some of them here. For instance, research shows that ', 'women’s ability to perform is hampered by their anxiety about negative stereotypes. ', 'Instead of being able to concentrate on difficult tasks, a significant proportion of their ', 'mental concentration is taken up by trying to quell their fears about their potential lack ', 'of ability [5]. ', '', 'My own experience bears this out. I have described in this paper how, after a few ', 'years in the profession, I found myself in a job where my requests to do more inter¬ ', 'esting work were denied. There was always a part of me which believed I was less ', 'capable than my male peers, and that it was therefore quite reasonable for those ', 'requests to be denied. I decided that I would be better off looking for success in other ', 'areas of my life - my family and my hobbies - and that I would accept that my job ', 'was simply something whose purpose was to pay the bills, rather than something I ', 'could expect to excel at or enjoy. ', '', 'Another problem is that the more successful a woman becomes in a male-dominated ', 'profession, the more she will be affected by stereotype threat. This is for several reasons: ', 'The more she moves up the ladder, the more of a minority she will find herself in. This ', 'will make her more anxious about other people’s assumptions, but will also encourage ', 'her to believe - by sheer force of statistics - that those assumptions are true. “One study ', 'found that the more men there are taking a mathematics test in the same room as a solo ', 'woman, the lower women’s performance becomes” [6]. ', '', 'The problem is not that girls are inherently less good at technology, or even that ', 'they’re less interested; it is that people expect less of them. For instance, some men and ', 'women were given a difficult mathematics test. Before they started, they were told that ', 'it was designed to better understand what makes some people better at mathematics than ', 'others. A control group were told the same thing, but were also told that thousands of ', 'students had been tested and no gender difference had ever been found. In all groups, ', 'the average score for men was 19 %. In the first group, women also averaged 19 %. But ', 'in the second group, women averaged 30 %. Even though gender was not explicitly ', 'mentioned to the first group, it did not need to be. They could make that connection for ', 'themselves, and their performance was affected. But once that stereotype threat was ', 'removed, the potential of the women appeared to be unlocked [7] . ', '', 'As well as stereotype threat, another important phenomenon is “unconscious bias”. ', 'This is effectively the technical term for what I have referred to in this paper as an “inner ', 'voice”. It refers to the automatic connections that most of us make, for instance between ', 'women and the arts, and between men and technology. ', '', '', 'How XP Can Improve the Experiences of Female Software Developers ', '', '', '267 ', '', '', 'One effect of unconscious bias can be that even when women are working within ', 'technology, both they and their colleagues do not see them as being in the correct role. ', 'This can be particularly true of women doing purely technical roles, such as software ', 'engineers. During my own career I have twice faced significant pressure to move out of ', 'a software role and into an organisational or management role. Luckily I was quite clear ', 'that I wouldn’t enjoy those roles. In both cases I did temporarily make the change, but ', 'quickly recognised that I was moving in the wrong direction, and fortunately I had the ', 'confidence to move myself quickly back into a technical role. ', '', 'The good news is that both unconscious bias and stereotype threat can be mitigated ', 'against by education. When people become aware that the problem exists, and how wide- ', 'ranging its effects are, they can start to do something about it. There are various organ¬ ', 'isations which offer “unconscious bias” training: this allows people from across a ', 'company to become aware of how unconscious bias and stereotype threat affect both ', 'the recruitment process and the ability of individuals to progress within the workplace. ', 'We are hoping to introduce this at LateRooms later this year. ', '', '3.3 The Positive Impact of XP ', '', 'The inner voice which whispers, “But you’re a girl,” has never entirely gone away. But ', 'the following working practices have allowed me to take positive actions to improve ', 'my own experience and counter all the problems caused by being in a minority: ', '', '1. Daily stand-ups: I have frequently flagged up problems, and the resulting help and ', 'reassurance have helped to alleviate any insecurities. ', '', '2. Team retrospectives: When my team at LateRooms recently experimented with mob ', 'programming, we found that we were sometimes getting carried away with strong ', 'opinions, which led to some colleagues feeling excessively judged and criticised. ', 'We agreed to be kinder to each other as a result. This highlights how effective the ', 'culture of the retrospective can be in helping team members who might potentially ', 'be discriminated against. ', '', '3. Pair programming: My skills have improved more quickly since I have been able to ', 'pair program. I assume I will always have something to learn. I assume the same is ', 'true of my colleagues. Although I may occasionally worry that my male colleagues ', 'are more proficient than I am, this is proved wrong on a daily basis when we sit side ', 'by side and I see that they learn from me as much as I learn from them. ', '', '4. Iterative development: The focus on iterative development and a good working rela¬ ', 'tionship between developers and stakeholders allows me to contribute towards a ', 'diverse and comprehensive understanding of the context in which my team finds ', 'ourselves. ', '', '5. Communication: The general supportive spirit has given me the confidence to ', 'explicitly ask for the support and encouragement I need to overcome any lack of ', 'confidence caused by being in a minority. ', '', 'All of these practices should already be present in XP teams, but it is worth being ', 'aware what a positive impact they can have on minority groups, and therefore ', 'consciously practising them with that in mind. ', '', '', '', '268 C. Sudbery ', '', '', '4 Conclusions ', '', 'After many years in the industry, I have encountered several problems to do with being ', 'a woman. The main problems have centred on my own lack of confidence in my ability ', 'to perform effectively in a technical role, and the tendency for colleagues to encourage ', 'me away from technical roles. The available literature - and my discussions with other ', 'women - would suggest that these are common problems for women in this industry. ', '', 'However, since I have been working with XP, I have experienced several benefits ', 'and improvements. I believe these are due partly to the emphasis on communication and ', 'collaboration, particularly in the form of pair programming, daily stand-ups and retro¬ ', 'spectives; and partly to the focus on iterative development and a good working rela¬ ', 'tionship between developers and stakeholders. These aspects have given me the oppor¬ ', 'tunity to evaluate my own skills more objectively, share knowledge and both give and ', 'receive the support I need. They have also allowed myself and my colleagues to evaluate ', 'and act upon any negative experiences within the team. ', '', 'Clearly the experience of women is important to all workplaces in our industry, ', 'whether they use XP or not. But because of the emphasis placed by XP on people over ', 'process, and because XP understands the very important relationship between devel¬ ', 'opers, business owners and stakeholders, then XP teams should not only care more about ', 'this, but are particularly well-placed to do something about it.

', '', 'Interestingly, most (if any) of my pairs had not practiced pair-programming in their ', 'daily work and working with me was, for many, the first exposure to pairing across ', 'skill levels.

It is through that experience I realised that social skills and ', 'emotional intelligence were powerful influencing factors in the success of pairing ', 'relationships.

', '', 'I repeated the talk and the question at XProLo meetup in front of a very experi¬ ', 'enced audience, and the results were the same.

Such teacher-student role division promotes a familiar classroom teaching style, ', 'whereby the teacher talks and demonstrates and the student listens. ', '', 'My experience has shown that pair-programming is most effective when both ', 'developers are equally involved and proactive throughout the session. Therefore, I ', 'propose to view pairing across skill in the light of the leader/adopter pattern. The latter ', 'suggests equal participation of both developers in the session, with the experienced ', 'developer acting as the leader and the junior, as the adopter. The skill set of the leader ', 'should include both technical excellence and emotional intelligence - one or the other ', 'alone is insufficient. The skill set of the adopter is incomplete, hence the role. ', '', 'During my time at YNAP I have had to heavily rely on my social skills to facilitate ', 'my own learning. This led me to a conclusion that technical expertise of an individual ', 'does not imply emotional maturity; consequently not all senior developers are good ', 'leaders. A simple metaphor of a parent teaching their child to ride a bike might ', 'help. The parent tasked with teaching is expected to not only be a confident cyclist ', 'themselves, but to be also adequately patient and articulated to lead their child through ', 'learning experience. From the adopter’s perspective, quality of pairing experience is ', 'heavily influenced by the emotional expertise of the leader. Continuing the cycling ', 'metaphor, the most effective teaching method involves a parent and a child working ', 'together as equals. In contrast, a parent demonstrating the technique by cycling around ', 'their child in silence, is obviously ineffective. Yet, when it comes to pair-programing, ', 'senior developers often choose the leading strategy of cycling around their junior pair. ', '', '', '274 I. Tsyganok ', '', '', '5.1 Can Anyone Be a Leader? ', '', 'Just like teaching a child to ride a bike, pairing with the junior demands patience, a ', 'teaching plan (that can change), time and willingness of the leader to get deeply ', 'involved. The latter is the deciding factor, yet in my experience it has not always been ', 'considered. ', '', 'The cycling analogy demonstrates the importance of acknowledgement and con¬ ', 'sent. A child who wants to ride a bike has no choice but to master cycling first. The ', 'parent, on the other hand, has a choice of either teaching their child themselves or ', 'asking someone else to do it. ', '', 'In making this decision, the parent has to analyse whether the amount of time they ', 'can spare for teaching, their own physical fitness and emotional skills needed to guide ', 'their child throughout learning experience are sufficient at a given point in time. If a ', 'parent identifies that for whatever reason they are unable to meet one or more of the ', 'suitability criteria, it is probably better to ask a friend or another family member to lead ', 'the teaching. To the child on the other hand, quality of teaching is more important than ', 'the person providing teaching. ', '', 'The suitability and unsuitability of the senior are not permanent. Circumstances ', 'may change over time to enable the parent to teach their now eagerly racing child new ', 'stunts on their bike. ', '', 'Coming back to pair-programming, in addition to acknowledging the fact that their ', 'pair is inexperienced, a senior developer has to asses whether they are willing and able ', 'to take on the role of a leader at a given moment in time. ', '', '', '5.2 The Social Aspect of Pair-Programming ', '', 'I have learned that for two developers to work enjoy ably and productively together, ', 'they need to get on well socially. This applies to all pairs regardless of technical ', 'expertise, but the experience may feel less natural in a junior/senior pair. ', '', 'I observed that the act of pair-programming despite being emotionally intense, can ', 'be socially isolating. Work environment places focus on technical expertise and pro¬ ', 'fessional status and filters social interactions through a prism of organisational culture. ', '', 'However, when two developers engage in an informal activity, such as having ', 'lunch or a drink after work together, their professional status matters much less and so ', 'does the organisational culture. Instead, the focus of their interaction shifts to personal ', 'and emotional. Those developers are no longer ‘a junior’ and ‘a senior’, they are just ', 'two people having a conversation. I have found that positive effects of informal ', 'communication transcend environments. That is, once the two developers get back to ', 'work, they find that their communication flows better, which in turn, empowers the pair ', 'to overcome challenges imposed by the experience gap, status and other constraints of ', 'the work environment.

', '', 'In the final year of my degree, I organised a Code Club at my local primary school, ', 'where I taught a class of seventeen children programming for one year, using a ', 'project-based curriculum and encouraging a free-form learning environment. My only ', 'two objectives throughout the year were that the children learn to code and have fun. ', 'Whether they wanted to work solo, in pairs or in a mob, was entirely up to them. ', '', 'Throughout that year, I observed most organic transitions of my students’ learning ', 'through various techniques. ', '', 'All children started the year in the classroom learning style. They had a computer and ', 'a project sheet each and worked solo, raising their hand as they needed my help. As ', 'projects became increasingly complex, many children chose to pair up with their friends - ', 'in a grown-up XP world we call this ‘pair-programming by association’. In their pairs, the ', 'children conversed freely, exchanging jokes and clearly enjoying each others’ company. ', '', 'However, as the difficulty of learning the material continued to increase, some ', 'children gravitated towards pairing with their more able classmates who were not ', 'necessarily their buddies outside of the classroom. Their conversations became more ', 'focused on the task, but the dialogue kept flowing at all times. In each pair there was a ', 'leader and an adopter, and both remained engaged throughout. ', '', 'Finally and very importantly, two of my students chose to work solo throughout the ', 'whole year. They did not object to helping their peers when prompted, but they clearly ', 'performed better and seemed more content having their own space. ', '', 'All children made amazing progress and many of them have taken their learning ', 'further. Reflecting on our experience, it is clear to me that the children loved the social ', 'aspect of our club just as much as they loved problem-solving. Another observation I made ', 'that year is that not everyone is happy in the role of leader despite displaying excellent ', 'technical aptitude. And that is a personal choice everyone should be entitled to. Unless ', 'these individuals want to step out of their comfort zone and take a leadership role, forcing ', 'them into pairing with a less experienced partner will never lead to a good experience.

', '', 'The motivation behind visualisation and limiting WIP was to identify the ', 'constraints of the process and to focus on a single item at a time. Additionally, instead ', 'of pushing work on to software developers, Kanban promotes a pull approach: when ', 'a team member finishes an existing task, he or she automatically pulls the next item ', 'to begin work. In brief, Kanban aims to provide visibility to the software develop¬ ', 'ment process, communicate priorities and highlight bottlenecks [6]. This process ', 'results in a constant flow of releasing work items to customers, as the developers ', 'focus only on a few items at a given time [7]. The proliferation of Kanban in soft¬ ', 'ware engineering boomed after the publication of key books. These seminal books ', 'included David Anderson’s Kanban [5], which introduces the concept of Kanban in ', 'systems and software development, and Corey Lada’s Scrumban [8], which discusses ', 'the fusion of Scrum and Kanban.

In fact, available literature ', 'gathers a rich collection of experience reports highlighting several points in com¬ ', 'mon between the two, but also several calls for a more systematic convergence ', 'of them. ', '', 'On the one hand, in fact, Agile methodologies do not explicitly address usabil¬ ', 'ity or user experience (UX) aspects in their understanding of the development ', 'process, although valuing customer satisfaction [17]. Yet, a carefully designed UX ', 'can provide an advantage over competing products [9] , giving “positive effects on ', 'both system success and user satisfaction” [10]. On the other hand, UCD does ', 'not explicitly address how implementation should be performed, despite needing ', 'to ensure that no “design drift” [14] occurs. Agile methodologies, popularised by ', 'their intrinsic embracing of change and constant involvement of the customer in ', 'the process [7], appear as a suitable match to this.

Bordin ', '', '', '2 Related Work ', '', 'User-centred design (UCD) is an umbrella term used to denote a set of tech¬ ', 'niques, methods, procedures that places the user at the centre of an iterative ', 'design process [13]. Since the benefits of involving users in systems design are ', 'widely acknowledged [1,10], several attempts at integrating UCD with Agile ', 'have emerged in recent years [9,14], leveraging on the large common ground ', 'that the two approaches seem to share. However, literature also highlights some ', 'divergences between them, or communication breakdowns [3], i.e. examples of ', 'disruptions due to the sudden ineffectiveness of existing working practices: ', '', '- in UCD, user involvement can range from informative, to consultative, to ', 'participative [8]; in Agile, the emphasis is put on the customer instead, who ', 'acts as a representative of users, but whose meaningfulness in this sense is ', 'often questioned (e.g. [IT]); ', '', '- the role of documentation may be interpreted differently: Agile methodologies ', 'encourage mostly face-to-face communication [2], while UCD also relies on ', 'artefacts to record design rationales [15]; ', '', '- there are different opinions about whether UCD and Agile should proceed in ', 'parallel (e.g. [18]) or should be merged into the same process (e.g. [11]), and ', 'to the amount of design to be performed before implementation [11]. ', '', '3 Methodology ', '', 'The research process has combined theoretical grounding and action research, ', 'performed in two main field studies. The first field study concerned a social ', 'innovation R&D project where UCD and Agile were both adopted and where ', 'the author served as interaction designer. This context provided several insights ', 'about critical aspects, or communication breakdowns [3], that may hamper the ', 'integration of the two approaches [4]; a subsequent literature review confirmed ', 'that such breakdowns had already emerged previously, but had not been sys¬ ', 'tematised yet. The second field study, performed in a software and interaction ', 'design company, allowed to further reinforce and extend the framework defined ', 'by identified breakdowns, turning these into focal points for driving decision in ', 'companies, facilitating communication between designers and developers, and ', 'supporting the management in the construction of a favourable context for a ', 'fruitful integration of UCD and Agile [5]. ', '', 'During both studies, data were collected from a number of sources, in par¬ ', 'ticular through interview studies, ethnographically-inspired personal observa¬ ', 'tions [12], and investigation of artefacts used to support working practices. These ', 'qualitative data were then thematically analysed [16] and resulting findings were ', 'supplemented with a more top-down stream of research, i.e. a literature review. ', '', '4 Results ', '', 'The two case studies described above have led to the identification and validation ', 'of a framework constituted by the following four communication breakdowns [4,5]. ', '', '', 'Towards a More User-Centred Agile Development 309 ', '', '', 'User involvement. Its perception may vary both between designers and devel¬ ', 'opers, and between the company and the customer: in any case, involved parties ', 'should explicitly share the same understanding of its extent. ', '', 'Documentation. In co-located teams, besides tracing history and design ratio¬ ', 'nales, documentation can help balance the power relationship with the customer, ', 'shielding the company from unsustainable changes in requirements. ', '', 'Synchronisation. If the team is not co-located, or has to incorporate a large ', 'amount of feedback, balancing the paces of design and development can be tricky, ', 'as it is not always possible or sufficient to rely on face-to-face communication. ', '', 'Task ownership. While it is advisable that the whole team shares a common ', 'language, the responsibility over design tasks should be clear and endorsed by ', 'the management, in order to fully support the added value that UCD can provide ', 'to the product. ', '', '5 Future Agenda ', '', 'A third field study is under way in an IT company with no UX expert, but need¬ ', 'ing to design and develop a software interface in a few months. Weekly workshops ', 'are being run drawing inspiration from design thinking [6] ; the development team ', 'is exposed to tools deriving from both UCD and Agile (e.g. personas, use-case ', 'diagrams, backlogs) in order to sharpen their understanding of the intended user ', 'and subsequently of the functionalities to offer, while keeping in mind the issues ', 'represented by identified communication breakdowns. The goal is to assist the ', 'working process of the team to assess whether and how their understanding of ', 'the user evolves and whether the introduction of mentioned tools may have an ', 'observable impact on the quality of the resulting interface.

However, those embarking on ', 'this path have found that the process of becoming an Agile organisation is not ', 'straightforward.

', '', '2 Motivation, Contribution and Originality ', 'of the Proposed Study ', '', 'Recently a lack of theoretical underpinnings for Agile research has been high¬ ', 'lighted by researchers as a cause for concern [2,3]. Criticisms include; a lack ', 'of empirical support for claims about the efficacy of Agile methods; no unified ', 'framework to guide the various streams of research; and a lack of methodological ', 'and theoretical rigour [4]. Addressing these concerns results in the selection of ', 'Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) [5] as a suitable theoretical framework to guide ', 'the research. ', '', 'DOI theory [5] has a strong theoretical basis and has been widely used to ', 'explain the diffusion process across a broad range of domains and disciplines ', '[6]. Within these traditions, studies have investigated different aspects of the ', 'diffusion process, including the consequences of innovations, this final aspect ', 'contributing less than 1 % of diffusion studies and will be key vehicle through ', 'which the results will be framed [5]. ', '', 'As an applied discipline, Information Systems research should result in find¬ ', 'ings that have both a theoretical and a practical application [7]. This latter ', 'requirement will be addressed by the development of a taxonomy allowing organ¬ ', 'isations to position themselves according to their organisational characteristics. ', 'The theoretical contribution of the study will arise from the application of (DOI) ', '[5] to an emergent area, business Agility. This will serve the dual purpose of test¬ ', 'ing the applicability of the theory to the domain and at the same time offers a ', 'repeatable, verifiable model through which to support further research, develop¬ ', 'ment of the existing theory, or the generation of new theory [8]. ', '', '3 Brief Literature Review ', '', 'Since 2001 much of the early focus and research into Agility has been tightly ', 'focused on the practices and processes of Agile software development teams. ', 'A number of researchers have synthesised and thematically categorised this ', 'extensive body of work [2,9-11]. These meta-analyses suggest that the exist¬ ', 'ing body of work is focussed on a subset of practice based topics. ', '', 'Whilst software Agility focusses on the practices contributing to software ', 'and product development, business Agility is a broader concept. In this regard ', 'Agile practices are often combined with the ideas behind Lean thinking [12] ', 'which share a close philosophical alignment. A number of high profile digital ', 'organisations have successfully demonstrated Agility as a whole of business app¬ ', 'roach [13]. One of the best know of these is Spotify though its own particular ', '', '', '314 ', '', '', 'K. van Haaster ', '', '', 'model of scaled Agility, generally known as the Spotify Model [14]. Organisa¬ ', 'tions that have attempted to transform to an Agile business model have found ', 'the landscape replete with complex challenges [15]. A relatively small number of ', 'case studies documenting the experiences of such organisations demonstrate this ', '[16,17]. A more recent development of interest to the business community are a ', 'number of frameworks which claim to address some of these issues and provide ', 'a transformation pathway to business Agility [18-21].

While estimating the size of the change, its impact on other arti¬ ', 'facts and context specific effort drivers need to be considered. ', '', 'Currently, effort estimation in this context relies heavily on human judgment. ', 'A cross-functional team of experts estimate by consensus how much effort a ', 'certain change will entail.

In Agile development, the strict distinctions between various phases of ', 'software development are blurred. With cross functional teams and a shared ', 'responsibility for the product instead of individual artifacts, software develop¬ ', 'ment also includes e.g. testing and user-documentation beyond just writing the ', 'source code. Thus, an effort estimate has to consider the impact of a change ', 'on various software artifacts e.g. regression testing at unit and functional level ', 'is now often considered part of development teams responsibility as part of a ', 'sprint.

', '', '3 Related Work ', '', 'Three main related areas are briefly discussed below: ', '', '3.1 Effort Estimation Methods ', '', 'In traditional software development, numerous effort estimation methods have ', 'been proposed in research. These may be classified as [1]: Data-driven (model- ', 'based, memory-based and composite) methods, (e.g. COCOMO I, Case-based ', 'reasoning and COCOMO II). Expert-based methods like Wideband Delphi, ', 'Planning Game, Analytic Hierarchy Process. Hybrid methods like Expert- ', 'COCOMO, Bayesian Belief Nets, and CoBRA® [2]. ', '', 'Each of these methods claims to have addressed a problem in effort estima¬ ', 'tion, however very few of them actually demonstrated the claims in industrial ', '', '', '318 ', '', '', 'B. Tanveer ', '', '', 'setting. Also very few individual studies are found that address the effort esti¬ ', 'mation specifically in the Agile context. Expert-based methods are found to be ', 'the most used estimation method in Agile context but their estimation accu¬ ', 'racy is hampered by inconsistencies and wishful thinking al. [3]. However, due ', 'to the lack of evidence that model-based methods like COCOMO produce more ', 'accurate estimates than expert judgment, the use of the former approach is ', 'widespread [5]. None of the existing estimation methods (in traditional or Agile ', 'development) so far have considered the quantification of the impact that a ', 'change has on existing software artifacts. Further, explicit consideration of the ', 'most relevant effort drivers is also not addressed in Expert-based methods. In ', 'Data-driven methods, to collect and analyze these effort drivers a huge amount ', 'of data and cost are required. The Hybrid methods, these effort drivers though ', 'are considered, but need to be adapted to Agile context. ', '', '3.2 Techniques for Change Impact Analysis ', '', 'A secondary study on change impact analysis [6] has identified 23 techniques ', 'which are broadly based on dependency and traceability analysis.

', 'For example, to show which software components will be effected by an added ', 'functionality heat-maps can be created. Several of the techniques identified by ', 'Bixinli et al.

Once stakeholders have thoroughly reviewed the plan and provided ', 'their approvals, the team starts to work. ', '', '4. Team members complete their specialized portion of the work, and ', 'then hand it off to others in production-line fashion. ', '', '5. Once the work is complete, it is delivered to a testing organization ', '(some call this Quality Assurance), which completes testing prior to the ', 'product reaching the customer. Throughout the process, strict controls are ', 'placed on deviations from the plan to ensure that what is produced is ', 'actually what was designed. ', '', 'This approach has strengths and weaknesses. Its great strength is that it is ', 'supremely logical - think before you build, write it all down, follow a plan, ', 'and keep everything as organized as possible. It has just one great ', 'weakness: humans are involved. Hence a lot of problems occur: ', '', '• Creativity is inhibited ', '', 'This approach requires that the good ideas all come at the beginning of the ', 'release cycle, where they can be incorporated into the plan. But as we all ', 'know, good ideas appear throughout the process - in the beginning, the ', 'middle, and sometimes even the day before launch. A process that does ', 'not permit change will stifle this innovation. With the waterfall, a great ', \"idea late in the release cycle is not a gift, it's a threat. \", '', '• Written documents have their limitations ', '', 'The waterfall approach places a great emphasis on writing things down as ', 'a primary method for communicating critical information. The very ', 'reasonable assumption is that if I can write down on paper as much as ', \"possible of what's in my head, it will more reliably make it into the head \", \"of everyone else on the team; plus, if it's on paper, there is tangible proof \", \"that I've done my job. The reality, though, is that most of the time these \", 'highly detailed 50-page requirements documents just do not get read. ', 'When they do get read, the misunderstandings are often compounded. A ', 'written document is an incomplete picture of my ideas; when you read it, ', 'you create another abstraction, which is now two steps away from what I ', 'think I meant to say at that time. It is no surprise that serious ', 'misunderstandings occur. ', '', '', '', \"Jeff Sutherland's Scrum Handbook \", '', '', '', '12 ', '', '', '', '• Bad timing ', '', 'Something else that happens when you have humans involved is the hands- ', 'on \"aha\" moment - the first time that you actually use the working product. ', 'You immediately think of 20 ways you could have made it better. ', 'Unfortunately, these very valuable insights often come at the end of the ', 'release cycle, when changes are most difficult and disruptive - in other ', 'words, when doing the right thing is most expensive, at least when using a ', 'traditional method. ', '', '• No crystal balls ', '', 'Humans are not able to predict the future. For example, your competition ', 'makes an announcement that was not expected. Unanticipated technical ', 'problems crop up that force a change in direction. Furthermore, people are ', 'particularly bad at planning uncertain things far into the future - guessing ', 'today how you will be spending your week eight months from now is ', 'something of a fantasy. It has been the downfall of many a carefully ', 'constructed Gantt chart. ', '', '• Too much work and no fun ', '', 'In addition, a sequential life cycle tends to foster an adversarial ', 'relationship between the people that are handing work off from one to the ', 'next. \"He\\'s asking me to build something that\\'s not in the specification.\" ', '\"She\\'s changing her mind.\" \"I can\\'t be held responsible for something I ', 'don\\'t control.\" And this gets us to another observation about sequential ', 'development - it is not much fun. The waterfall model is a cause of great ', 'misery for the people who build products. The resulting products fall well ', 'short of expressing the creativity, skill, and passion of their creators. ', 'People are not robots, and a process that requires them to act like robots ', 'results in unhappiness. ', '', '• Sub-optimized results ', '', 'A rigid, change-resistant process produces mediocre products. Customers ', 'may get what they first ask for (at least two translation steps removed), but ', 'is it what they really want once they see the product?

Unfortunately, many teams find just the opposite: ', 'the harder they try, the worse it gets!

However, ', 'the Product Owner is somewhat different than a traditional ', 'Product Manager because they actively and frequently ', 'interact with the team, personally offering the priorities and ', 'reviewing the results each two- or four-week iteration, rather than ', 'delegating development decisions to a project manager. It is ', 'important to note that in Scrum there is one and only one person who ', 'serves as - and has the final authority of - Product Owner.

In this case, there will ', 'be some remaining work, such as final production environment ', 'integration testing, and so there will be the need for a \"Release ', 'Sprint\" to handle this remaining work. A goal of any Scrum Team is ', 'to minimize the number of Release Sprints for completing \"undone\" ', 'work. Undone work tends to accumulate exponentially and causes ', 'poor product quality. ', '', '', '', 'Release Planning & Initial Product Backlog ', 'Refinement ', '', 'A question that is sometimes asked is how, in an iterative model, can ', 'long-term release planning be done. There are two cases to consider: ', '(1) a new product in its first release, and (2) an existing product in a ', 'later release. ', '', 'In the case of a new product, or an existing product just adopting ', 'Scrum, there is the need to do initial Product Backlog refinement ', 'before the first Sprint, where the Product Owner and team shape a ', 'proper Scrum Product Backlog. This could take a few days or a ', 'week, and involves a vision workshop, some detailed requirements ', 'analysis, and estimation of all the items identified for the first ', 'release. ', '', 'Surprisingly in Scrum, in the case of an established product with ', 'an established Product Backlog, there should not be the need for any ', 'special or extensive release planning for the next release. Why? ', 'Because the Product Owner and team should be doing Product ', 'Backlog refinement every Sprint (five or ten percent of each Sprint), ', 'continuously preparing for the future. This continuous product ', 'development mode obviates the need for the dramatic punctuated ', 'prepare-execute-conclude stages one sees in traditional sequential ', 'life cycle development. ', '', 'During an initial Product Backlog refinement workshop and ', 'during the continuous backlog refinement each Sprint, the Team and ', '', '', '', '31 ■ ', '', '', '', 'Product Owner will do release planning, refining the estimates, ', 'priorities, and content as they learn. ', '', 'Some releases are date-driven; for example: \"We will release ', 'version 2.0 of our project at a trade-show on November 10.\" In this ', 'situation, the team will complete as many Sprints (and build as many ', 'features) as is possible in the time available. Other products require ', 'certain features to be built before they can be called complete and the ', 'product will not launch until these requirements are satisfied, ', 'however long that takes. Since Scrum emphasizes producing ', 'potentially shippable code each Sprint, the Product Owner may ', 'choose to start doing interim releases, to allow the customer to reap ', 'the benefits of completed work sooner. ', '', 'Since they cannot possibly know everything up front, the focus is ', 'on creating and refining a plan to give the release broad direction, ', 'and clarify how tradeoff decisions will be made (scope versus ', 'schedule, for example). Think of this as the roadmap guiding you ', 'towards your final destination; which exact roads you take and the ', 'decisions you make during the journey may be determined en route. ', '', 'Most Product Owners choose one release approach.
